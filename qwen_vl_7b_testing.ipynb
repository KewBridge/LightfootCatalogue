I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully removed and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore ensues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose.\\n\\nThere are two varieties, the smaller one which I send, and the larger from Nicaragua, which produces a pod like cotton.

Hanbury\\'s handwriting are attached to these specimens:\\n\\n\"Agrees well with \\'Krameria Ixina, L., Mexico,\\' Herb. Pavon; also with the same plant marked \\'Curassao, Mr. Von Rohr, 1783.\\' It seems to be the same species as \\'Krameria,\\' collected by Gardner (no number), marked as \\'Common,\\' on dry hilly pastures in the Sartao, of the Province of Ceara, Sept., 1838; the same also as \\'Krameria, No. 925,\\' of Gardner\\'s Brazilian Plants, British Museum, 12 May, 1854. Professor Oliver and I compared this plant with the species of Krameria in the Hookerian Herbarium, and found it to agree with Krameria, No. 925, marked in Gardner\\'s writing thus:-\\'A shrub about 3 feet high with long spreading branches, on a low hill covered with bushes, in the interior of the island of Itamarica, Dec., 1837.\\'\"\\n\\n\"There is no specimen in the Linnean Herbarium. A full description of Krameria Ixina is contained in \\'Laëlling, Iter Hispanicum\\' (Stockholm, 1758, p. 195). The leaves of the plant are stated to be \\'alterna, lanceolata, superiora linearia acuta, subsessilia,\\' terms which are not inapplicable to the British Museum specimen (Pavon and Rohr\\'s), admitting the bracts to be the linear, acute, subsessile upper leaves. Gardner\\'s \\'Krameria, No. 4094, from upland sandy campos, Serra Geral, Province of Goyaz, May, 1860,\\' and \\'No. 2781, District of the Rio Prato, Province of Pernambuco, Sept., 1839,\\' is a species coming very near to K. Ixina (assuming No. 925 to be that plant), but the entire plant is rather more shaggy, and the fruit has the spines more numerous, not barbed, with only a few scattered hairs between them (instead of a dense tomentum)\". [See paper by Hanbury in Proc. Roy. Hort. Soc., Nov. and Dec. 1864, p. 181; Pharm. Journ. (2), vi., p. 460; \\'Science Papers,\\' p. 323.]\\n\\nThe following description, quoted from a letter from J.

Xanthoxylum piperitum, D.C.,\\nClapham, cultivated in the garden, 1 Oct., 1864.\\nThis specimen has only the flowers, but is accompanied by a pen and ink sketch of the young fruit.\\n[Note.—The fruit of X. alatum is covered with small, raised, scattered tubercles, which are apparently oil glands. These are more abundant and crowded in X. Bungei. The fruit of X. piperitum in the Hanbury Collection of Materia Medica differs from both these in having a reticulated surface, in which the oil glands appear to be sunken. Mr. Stronach\\'s specimen has crowded tubercles like the other specimens of X. Bungei. It is not apparent, therefore, why Hwa-tseaou is stated in \\'Science Papers,\\' p. 228, to be applied to the fruits of \"the two species of Xanthoxylum,\" viz.: X. piperitum, D.C., and X. alatum, Roxb., since from the Herbarium specimens above enumerated it would seem that fruits of X. alatum are used in Hang-Chow under the name of Hwa-tseaon, and those of X.

See Encyclopédie Méthodique, Botanique, tome iv., p. 191.\\n\\nb. Leaflets and flowers, and tracing of fruit.\\nThe leaflets and flowers were received from Dr. Klotzsch, 30 Aug., 1853, under the name of Myroxylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch; M. peruiferum, Kl., in Hayne\\'s Arzney-Gewächse, vol. xiv., t. 2; Myrospermum pedicellatum, Lamarck. The tracing is that of the pods of (Myroxylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch) \"Myrospermum balsamiferum,\" in Pavon\\'s collection in the British Museum.\\n\\nOf these specimens Hanbury remarks:—\"Four specimens of the above, marked thus, are in Pavon\\'s Herbarium in the British Museum; all have flowers and fruits also in a more or less young state; in none does the fruit appear quite mature. J. J. Bennett and Professor Guibourt agree with me as to the identity of these four specimens of the above.\"\\n—D.H., 20 Sept., 1853.\\n\\nHanbury has also placed the word \"No! D. H., 5 Aug., 1865,\" against the words, Myrospermum pedicellatum, Lamarck, thus indicating that he does not believe it to be identical with Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, (Bonplandia, 15 Sept., 1857, p. 276), as may also be seen by the following memorandum attached to this specimen:\\n\\n\"Myrospermum pedicellatum, Lamarck, of which the original specimen, collected by J. de Jussieu, is at Paris, I regard as identical with M. peruiferum, Linn. f., and consequently as distinct from Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch. Of Klotzsch\\'s M. pedicellatum, the only specimens I know are those derived from Ruiz and Pavon\\'s Herbarium. These were confounded by Lambert with Myroxyylon punctatum, Klotzsch, a plant with large leaves and pods. Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, has always (as it seems to me) an oval (not oblong) leaf which never dries flat. The leaf is also greyish, the flowers dry brown as if the standard were deep yellow when fresh. I saw in Paris (if I am not mistaken, but Triana maintains that I am) at the Museum, 28 July, 1864, a scrap of this plant attached to a sheet of M. punctatum, and pointed it out to Triana, who thereupon marked it in pencil.\"\\n\\nForma γ.—Myroxyylon pubescens, H.

From S. W. W. J. Hooker; 6 June, 1861 (P. elegans, Vog.?).—D.H. The following note by S. Hayes is attached to the specimen d:\\n\\n\"Fruit and bark of a large tree growing in a wood along the P. R. R. between Gorgona and Matachin, collected 12 Mar., 1861. Early in this month the leaves fall, and soon after the fruit ripens. The first trees I saw had all leaves, and here only fruit. The bark is very rough, the\\n\\ntrunks of the trees being very uneven with deep crevices and projecting angles, sometimes as if twisted. These trunks are from one to two feet in diameter, of good hard wood, excellent for fuel, and of a yellowish colour. They are, with their spreading tops, sixty or seventy feet in height. I have specimens of the leaves, as good as I can get at this season of the year, and shall send some of them; and that there may be no mistake or confusion in getting together the fruits of one tree and the leaves of another, I shall place a little of the fruit with them. The native name of the tree is \"Frijolillo.\" I could not fail to observe the great resemblance this tree bears to the balsam tree of San Salvador, but the leaves are very different and the juice of the tree dries up to a kind of gum, like kino, and is not balsamic.

I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully removed and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore ensues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose.\n",

Professor Oliver and I compared this plant with the species of Krameria in the Hookerian Herbarium, and found it to agree with Krameria, No. 925, marked in Gardner's writing thus:-'A shrub about 3 feet high with long spreading branches, on a low hill covered with bushes, in the interior of the island of Itamarica, Dec., 1837.'\"\n",

The leaves of the plant are stated to be 'alterna, lanceolata, superiora linearia acuta, subsessilia,' terms which are not inapplicable to the British Museum specimen (Pavon and Rohr's), admitting the bracts to be the linear, acute, subsessile upper leaves. Gardner's 'Krameria, No. 4094, from upland sandy campos, Serra Geral, Province of Goyaz, May, 1860,' and 'No. 2781, District of the Rio Prato, Province of Pernambuco, Sept., 1839,' is a species coming very near to K.

Wallich's specimens are from Martaban, and Griffith's, one of which is enclosed, from Malacca.

I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully removed and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore ensues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose.\n",

I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully removed and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore ensues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose.\\n\\nThere are two varieties, the smaller one which I send, and the larger from Nicaragua, which produces a pod like cotton. From the flowers a feeble counter-irritant is produced. Flowers in June and July.\\n\\n(Letter from Dr. Dorat. Sonsonate 12, Aug., 63.)\\n\\n7. Clematis Flammula, L.\\na.

The leaves of the plant are stated to be \\'alterna, lanceolata, superiora linearia acuta, subsessilia,\\' terms which are not inapplicable to the British Museum specimen (Pavon and Rohr\\'s), admitting the bracts to be the linear, acute, subsessile upper leaves.

The fruit of X. piperitum in the Hanbury Collection of Materia Medica differs from both these in having a reticulated surface, in which the oil glands appear to be sunken. Mr. Stronach\\'s specimen has crowded tubercles like the other specimens of X. Bungei.

See Encyclopédie Méthodique, Botanique, tome iv., p. 191.\\n\\nb. Leaflets and flowers, and tracing of fruit.\\nThe leaflets and flowers were received from Dr. Klotzsch, 30 Aug., 1853, under the name of Myroxylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch; M. peruiferum, Kl., in Hayne\\'s Arzney-Gewächse, vol. xiv., t. 2; Myrospermum pedicellatum, Lamarck. The tracing is that of the pods of (Myroxylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch) \"Myrospermum balsamiferum,\" in Pavon\\'s collection in the British Museum.\\n\\nOf these specimens Hanbury remarks:—\"Four specimens of the above, marked thus, are in Pavon\\'s Herbarium in the British Museum; all have flowers and fruits also in a more or less young state; in none does the fruit appear quite mature. J. J. Bennett and Professor Guibourt agree with me as to the identity of these four specimens of the above.\"\\n—D.H., 20 Sept., 1853.\\n\\nHanbury has also placed the word \"No! D. H., 5 Aug., 1865,\" against the words, Myrospermum pedicellatum, Lamarck, thus indicating that he does not believe it to be identical with Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, (Bonplandia, 15 Sept., 1857, p. 276), as may also be seen by the following memorandum attached to this specimen:\\n\\n\"Myrospermum pedicellatum, Lamarck, of which the original specimen, collected by J. de Jussieu, is at Paris, I regard as identical with M. peruiferum, Linn. f., and consequently as distinct from Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch. Of Klotzsch\\'s M. pedicellatum, the only specimens I know are those derived from Ruiz and Pavon\\'s Herbarium. These were confounded by Lambert with Myroxyylon punctatum, Klotzsch, a plant with large leaves and pods. Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, has always (as it seems to me) an oval (not oblong) leaf which never dries flat. The leaf is also greyish, the flowers dry brown as if the standard were deep yellow when fresh. I saw in Paris (if I am not mistaken, but Triana maintains that I am) at the Museum, 28 July, 1864, a scrap of this plant attached to a sheet of M. punctatum, and pointed it out to Triana, who thereupon marked it in pencil.\"\\n\\nForma γ.—Myroxyylon pubescens, H.

The bark is very rough, the\\n\\ntrunks of the trees being very uneven with deep crevices and projecting angles, sometimes as if twisted. These trunks are from one to two feet in diameter, of good hard wood, excellent for fuel, and of a yellowish colour. They are, with their spreading tops, sixty or seventy feet in height. I have specimens of the leaves, as good as I can get at this season of the year, and shall send some of them; and that there may be no mistake or confusion in getting together the fruits of one tree and the leaves of another, I shall place a little of the fruit with them. The native name of the tree is \"Frijolillo.\" I could not fail to observe the great resemblance this tree bears to the balsam tree of San Salvador, but the leaves are very different and the juice of the tree dries up to a kind of gum, like kino, and is not balsamic.

I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully removed and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore ensues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose.\\n\\nThere are two varieties, the smaller one which I send, and the larger from Nicaragua, which produces a pod like cotton.

H.: \"Cocculus Chondodendron, Dec.; Chondodendron tomentosum, R. & P.; Cissampelos Abutua, Velloso, Flor. Flum. x.t. 140, and Botryopsis platyphylla Miers.

Seedling plant, and a very large leaf.\\n\\nThe seedling plant was raised at Clapham from seeds received from Mr. Glaziou, 1874; the leaf was sent by T. Peckolt, 1867. Attached to this sheet is the proof of the drawing of the fruit published in Pharm. Journ., 2 Aug., 1873.\\n\\n[Specimen b differs from the other specimen of C. tomentosum in the more acuminate leaves, although younger leaves on a separate shoot are obtuse. The super-cription of Chondodendron tomentosum over Botryopsis platyphylla in these specimens appears to have followed a recognition of the fact pointed out to D. H. by E. M. H., that the Kew specimens at that time labelled Botryopsis platyphylla were identical with those at the British Museum labelled Chondodendron tomen-tosum, R. & P., and were different from the British Museum specimens of Botryopsis platyphylla, Miers.]\\n\\n21.
