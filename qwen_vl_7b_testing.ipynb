The following extract is attached to this specimen: \"Among the dried specimens I send a portion of a vine, or large creeper, called by the Indians \\'Crespa,\\' or blistering leaf, much used among them and among many of the native doctors. I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully re- moved and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore en- sues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose. \"There are two varieties, the smaller one which I send, and the larger from Niasaguna, which produces a pod like cotton. From the flowers a feeble counter-irritant is produced. Flowers in June and July.\" (Letter from Dr. Dorat. Sonsonate 12, Aug., 63.)\\n7. Clematis Flammula, L. a. Twig in flower with detached fruits.

Hook. as we have none, neither have we of flowers? Wallich’s specimens are from Martaban, and Griffith’s, one of which is enclosed, from Malacca. Hooker and Bentham retain the plant in Sterculia (S. scaphigerus), and Brown in “Plantes Javanices” ranks it as a genus under the name of Scaphium Wallischi.” [See Pharm. Journ.

Appended to this sheet is a long descriptive botanical account of the plant, in Portuguese, from Dr. Allemão, who evidently regarded the tree as a new species ; but Mr. Hanbury, in his note book (vii. p. 314), writes as follows :—Dr. Allemão has been so good as to send me some leaves of this tree (M. erythroxylum, Allemão), from an examination of which I am of your (Capanema) opinion that it is the same species as M. perniferum, Linn. f. \"—D.

The tracing, taken 6 February, 1865, is from Lamarck, Ill. Pl. 341. Communicated by M. Brongniart, per J. Triana ; received Jan., 1865. See Encyclopédie Méthodique, Botanique, tome iv., p. 191. b. Leaflets and flowers, and tracing of fruit. The leaflets and flowers were received from Dr. Klotzsch, 30 Aug., 1853, under the name of Myroxyylon pedicel- latum, Klotzsch ; M. perniferum, Kl., in Hayne\\'s Arzney- Gewächse, vol. xiv., t. 2 ; Myropernum pedicellatum, Lamarck. The tracing is that of the pods of (Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch) \"Myropernum bal- samiferum,\" in Pavon\\'s collection in the British Museum. Of these specimens Hanbury remarks :—\"Four specimens of the above, marked thus, are in Pavon\\'s Herbarium in the British Museum ; all have flowers and fruits also in a more or less young state ; in none does the fruit appear quite mature. J. J. Bennett and Professor Gulbourn agree with me as to the identity of these four specimens of the above.\" —D. H., 20 Sept., 1853.',\n",

       "     '\"Myrosernum pedicellatum, Lamarc, of which the original specimen, collected by J. de Jussieu, is at Paris, I regard as identical with M. perafernum, Linn.

These were confounded by Lambert with Myrozyylon punetatum, Klotzsch, a plant with large leaves and pods. Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, has always (as it seems to me) an oval (not oblong) leaf which never dries flat. The leaf is also greyish, the flowers dry brown as if the standard were deep yellow when fresh. I saw in Paris (if I am not mistaken, but Triana maintains that I am) at the Museum, 25 July, 1884, a scrap of this plant attached to a sheet of M. punetatum, and pointed it out to Triana, who thereupon marked it in pencil.\"',\n",

Bra., and is his \"Menispermaceae, No. 6, Folhas de Abutus grande ou Pareira Brava Grande.\" It was compared with Aublet's specimen in British Museum, 17 June, 1873, by D. H., who adds in pencil, \"same as 3660 Abuta, Rio de Janeiro, Coll. Glaziou, in Herb. Kew. Doubtfully referred to Abuta rufescens, Aubl. in Herb. Burchell at Kew, but seems to me the same species. 14 June, 1873.\"\n",
      "20. Chondodendron tomentosum, R. & P. a. Leaves. From Pl. Bras. J. Correa de Mello. The leaves are respec- tively labelled in his writing: \"(1) Menispermacae, No. 3, Cissampelos? (Folhas da planta qui produira Pareira brava)\"; (2) \"Folha da Abutia de St. Sebastiao\"; (3) \"Abutia de St. Sebastiao.\" By D. H. the sheets are labelled: \"Botryopus platyphylla, Miers.\" b. Ditto. This is Menispermacae, No. 5. \"Folhas da Abutia pequena on Pareira brava pequena\" of J. Correa de Mello, and is also labelled by D. H.: \"Botryopus platyphylla, Miers.\" c. Ditto. Leafy stem with detached portion of stem and young fruit. This is \"No. 5, Abuta minula, Butinha vel Pareira brava minula,\" from Theodor Peckolt, Cantagallo, Brazil, 1867, and is labelled by D. H.: \"(Botryopus platyphylla, Miers),\" and superscribed \"Chondodendron tomentosum, R. & P.\" d. Twig, with leaves and detached inflorescence. From Theodor Peckolt, Cantagallo, Brazil, 1867, and is labelled in D. H.'s writing: \"Botryopus platyphylla, Miers (Eichler in Martius' Fl. Bras., fasc. 38, tab. 48),\" and is superscribed: \"Chondodendron tomentosum, R. & P.\" e. Ditto, a second specimen. f. Flowering twig, with smaller leaves. This is labelled: \"No. 5 Butinha vel Pareira Brava minula; with dried stems, from Theodor Peckolt, 1867 ;\" it is also labelled with the two botanical names. g. Ditto, a second specimen, with portion of stem and detached fruit. Labelled as above, and also as \"Abuta minula.\" h. A third specimen, with stem and panicle of young fruit. i. Ditto, a fourth specimen, with large leaves. h and i are labelled in the same way as g. j. A flowering and a fruiting twig. [The first r in the name Chondodendron is here omitted in deference to the opinion expressed by the late Daniel Hanbury. 'Science Papers,' p. 387.\n",
      "This is No. 7 \"Butua legitima vel Pareira Brava legitima,\" Theodor Peckolt, 1867, and is labelled by D. H.: \"Cocculus Chondodendron, Dec. ; Chondodendron tonen- tanum, R. & P. ; Cissampelos Abutus, Velloso, Flor. Flum. x.t. 140, and Botevogias platyphylla Miers. With large specimen of stem and fruits, both dried and in alcohol.\" k. Seedling plant, and a very large leaf. The seedling plant was raised at Clapham from seeds received from Mr. Glazion, 1874; the leaf was sent by T. Peckolt, 1867.

The seedling plant was raised at Clapham from seeds received from Mr. Glazion, 1874; the leaf was sent by T. Peckolt, 1867. Attached to this sheet is the proof of the drawing of the fruit published in Pharm. Journ., 2 Aug., 1873. [Specimen b differs from the other specimen of C. tonentanum in the more acuminate leaves, although younger leaves on a separate shoot are obtuse. The super- scription of Chondodendron tonentanum over Botevogias platyphylla in these specimens appears to have followed a recognition of the fact pointed out to D. H. by E. M. H., that the Kew specimens at that time labelled Botevogias platyphylla were identical with those at the British Museum labelled Chondodendron tonen- tanum, R. & P, and were different from the British Museum specimens of Botevogias platyphylla, Miers.] 21.
