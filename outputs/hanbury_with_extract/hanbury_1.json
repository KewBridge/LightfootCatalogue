Clematis Carpepinsis, H.B.K. \"Crespa.\" a. Twig in fruit. The following extract is attached to this specimen: \"Among the dried specimens I send a portion of a vine, or large creeper, called by the Indians 'Crespa,' or blistering leaf, much used among them and among many of the native doctors. I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully re- moved and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore en- sues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose. \"There are two varieties, the smaller one which I send, and the larger from Niasaguna, which produces a pod like cotton. From the flowers a feeble counter-irritant is produced. Flowers in June and July.\" (Letter from Dr. Dorat. Sonsonate 12, Aug., 63.) 7. Clematis Flammula, L. a. Twig in flower with detached fruits.

Attached to this sheet is the proof of the drawing of the fruit published in Pharm. Journ., 2 Aug., 1873. [Specimen b differs from the other specimen of C. tonentanum in the more acuminate leaves, although younger leaves on a separate shoot are obtuse. The super- scription of Chondodendron tonentanum over Botryopsis platyphylla in these specimens appears to have followed a recognition of the fact pointed out to D. H. by E. M. H., that the Kew specimens at that time labelled Botryopsis platyphylla were identical with those at the British Museum labelled Chondodendron tonen- tanum, R. & P, and were different from the British Museum specimens of Botryopsis platyphylla, Miers.] 21.

Leaves, with detached bark and fruit. Received from N. Wilson, Bath, Jamaica, 3 Nov., 1856. A note is appended in Hanbury's writing to this specimen, quoting a statement by Mr. N. Wilson, that'when growing on the plain it is a strong and bushy shrub, not more that 10 or 12 feet high, and having much the appearance of the Laurustinus (Viburnum Tinus, L.) of Europe. When growing on the mountains it attains a much larger size, being 50 or 60 feet in height.' The Catalogue of the Jamaica Contributions to the Paris Exhibition describes it as'Wild Cinnamon, Castilla alba,' a common tree on mountains and rocky hills, and in lower woods, growing to 40 or 50 feet (p. 36).

(Krameria Ixina, L., var. # granatennis Triana.) a. Flowering branches. b. Ditto, with detached portion of root. Jiron, near Pamplona, New Granada. John Weir, 1 Feb., 1864.'The root is collected and shipped to Europe where it is known as Savannila Rhatany.' The following notes in D. Hanbury's handwriting are attached to these specimens :\u2014'Agrees well with'Krameria Ixina, L., Mexico,' Herb. Pavon ; also with the same plant marked'Curassao, Mr. Von Rohr, 1783.' It seems to be the same species as'Krameria,' collected by Gardiner (no number), marked as'Common,' on dry hilly pastures in the Sartao, of the Province of Ceara, Sept., 1838 ; the same also as'Krameria, No. 925,' of Gardner's Brazilian Plants, British Museum, 12 May, 1854. Professor Oliver and I compared this plant with the species of Krameria in the Hookerian Herbarium, and found it to agree with Krameria, No. 925, marked in Gardner's writing thus :\u2014' A shrub about 3 feet high with long spreading branches, on a low hill covered with bushes, in the interior of the island of Humarics, Dec., 1857.'\n\n\" There is no specimen in the Linnean Herbarium. A full description of Krameria Isina is contained in'Lostling, Her Hispanenum' (Stock- holm, 1738, p. 195). The leaves of the plants are stated to be'alterna, lanceolata, superioura linearia acuta, subsecundilis,' terms which are not inapplicable to the British Museum specimen (Pavon and Rohrs), admitting the leaves to be the linear, acute, subsecundile upper leaves. Gardner's'Krameria, No. 4094, from upland sandy campos, Serra Geral, Province of Goyaz, May, 1860,' and'No. 2781, District of the Rio Prato, Province of Pernambuco, Sept., 1860,' is a species coming very near to K. Isina (assuming No. 253 to be that plant), but the entire plant is rather more shaggy, and the fruit has the spinos more numerous, not barbed, with only a few scattered hairs between them (instead of a dense tomentum).' [See paper by Hanbury in Proc. Roy. Hort. Soc., Nov. and Dec. 1864, p. 181; and Pharn. Journ. 53, vi., p. 469; 'Science Papers,' p. 325.]\n\nThe following description, quoted from a letter from J. Triana, is also appended:'Krameria Isina var. A granatensis auffretex vovosus, folia acutis in petiolo attenuatis, spatulatice, acutis, spinoscatulis, crassis, obvatis; sicereis, sicut tota planta pube brevissimam incanae, supracentis in horto linearis pungentia acuminatibus, floribus pedicellatis in racemos terminalibus digestis, fructa globo magnitudinis pisi, aculeis retrovornis adnervis maricanto, Laperiensi.'\n\nA specimen of K.

The roots, I now find, are much esteemed as a remedy here; decoctions drank in tea have performed great cures in old chronic gonorrhoea. The botanical specimens were taken, some from the tree, which yielded the gum, and others from those from which I took the roots; not observing any specific difference, I have put them together.\"\n\nSpecimen b is labelled, \"Yields a red gum, applied exter- nally in ringworm, &c.

To specimen (e) two letters are attached, one from Dr. Hooker, and another from Alphonse De Candolle. The former letter has a note attached in Daniel Henbury's writing, to the following effect: \"Subsequent comparison with a large suite of specimens from the Kew Herbarium, as well as specimens from the Herbarium of the Linnean Society, fully confirmed Dr. Hooker's opinion that the Hang- Chow plant is Xanthoxyllum alatum, Roxb.\" In the other letter De Candolle states that he has compared Hanbury's X. alatum with Xanthoxyllum aconthopodium, D.C., and that the latter is very different, having imparipinnate leaves with 9 leaflets, not terete, the rachis more narrowly winged, the leaflets longer, more gradually attenuated above, and generally long; thin spines (\"aculeoles\") on the middle side. The secondary ones are more closely approxi- mated, more numerous, more prominent, and the leaflets are pubescent on the secondary veins. The length of the leaf is 7-8 inches. The spines of the rachis are more veined.\n\n88. Xanthoxyllum Bungei, Pianchon. a. Leafy stem. Garden, Clapham Common, 7 Aug., 1866. Raised from seed received from Pekin. b.

These are more abundant and crowded in X. Bungei. The fruit of X. pipertum in the Hanbury Collection of Materia Medica differs from both these in having a reticulated surface, in which the oil glands appear to be sunken. Mr. Stronach's specimen has crowded tubercles like the other specimens of X. Bungei. It is not apparent, therefore, why Hwa-teaen is stated in 'Science Papers,' p. 228, to be applied to the fruits of \u201cthe two species of Xanthoxylum,\u201d viz.: X. pipertum, D.C., and X. alatum, Roxb., since from the Herbarium specimens above enumerated it would seem that fruits of X. alatum are used in Hang-Chow under the name of Hwa- teaen, and these of X.

To this species must be added as a synonym Cupania laxiflora, (Spruce), Benth. Bentham has been perhaps induced to hold his laxiflora for different from Martius' C. micrantha, with reference to a Cujabian specimen of C. micrantha given out in the Herb. Hort. Bras., sub. No. 274, but I believe this is only a'vegetior,' and thickly flowering form of the C. micrantha, growing in the fertile, not the inundated, soil of Cujaba. If this No. 274 should prove different from the true C. micrantha, it would be necessary to keep up the name of C. micrantha, Mart. (including C. laxiflora), and to establish a new name for 274, but I believe that Mr. Bentham shall not find any powerful distinctive note in leaves and flowers.\"\n\n[As the other two specimens are marked, in Hanbury's writing, \"C. micrantha, Mart?\"] I submitted the specimens\n\n28 DISCITIORE to Dr. Radikofcr, in Oct., 1885, during his stay at Kew, where he was working at a monograph of the Sopliadaceae, and he identified them as Mutsysa guineensis; Aubl.] In Benth. and Hook.

Triana; received Jan., 1865. See Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique, Botanique, tome iv., p. 191.\n\nb. Leaflets and flowers, and tracing of fruit. The leaflets and flowers were received from Dr. Klotzsch, 30 Aug., 1853, under the name of Myroxyylon pedicel- latum, Klotzsch; M. perafernum, Kl., in Hayne's Arzney- Gew\u00e4chse, vol. xiv., t. 2; Myropernum pedicellatum, Lamarck. The tracing is that of the pods of (Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch) \"Myropernum bal- samiferum,\" in Pavon's collection in the British Museum.\n\nOf these specimens Hanbury remarks:\u2014\"Four specimens of the above, marked thus, are in Pavon's Herbarium in the British Museum; all have flowers and fruits also in a more or less young state; in none does the fruit appear quite mature. J. J. Bennett and Professor Gulbourn agree with me as to the identity of these four specimens of the above.\" \u2014D. H., 20 Sept., 1853.\n\nCALYCIPLORIS. 45 Hanbury has also placed the word \u201cNo! 1 D. H., 3 Aug, 1865,\u201d against the words, Myrosernum pedicellatum, Lamarc, thus indicating that he does not believe it to be identical with Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, (Bonplandia, 15 Sept., 1857, p. 276), as may also be seen by the following memorandum attached to this specimen: \u201cMyrosernum pedicellatum, Lamarc, of which the original specimen, collected by J. de Jussieu, is at Paris, I regard as identical with M. perafernum, Linn. L., and consequently as distinct from Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch. Of Klotzsch\u2019s M. pedicellatum, the only specimens I know are those derived from Ruiz and Pavon\u2019s Herbarium. These were confounded by Lambert with Myrozyylon punetatum, Klotzsch, a plant with large leaves and pods. Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, has always (as it seems to me) an oval (not oblong) leaf which never dries flat. The leaf is also greyish, the flowers dry brown as if the standard were deep yellow when fresh. I saw in Paris (if I am not mistaken, but Triana maintains that I am) at the Museum, 25 July, 1884, a scrap of this plant attached to a sheet of M. punetatum, and pointed it out to Triana, who thereupon marked it in pencil.\u201d Forma y.\u2014Myrozyylon pubescens, H.

Cette espee est en effet, fort peu connue, et je ne connais pas encore une description de ses fleurs et de ses fruits.\n\nCALYCIIFLOR.E. 51 Cependant les \u00e9chantillons que nous avons sous les yeux s'accordent si bien avec la description que nous avons faite nous-m\u00eame des feuilles, d'apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9chantillon authentique du Myroperumna toludferna recueillie aux environs de Tolu, par M. de Humboldt, que nous avons cru pouvoir y rapporter l'arbre de l'\u00eele de Cuba. Cet arbre y est connu des habitants comme donnant une mati\u00e8re balsamique, qu'ils d\u00e9signent sous le nom de \"Romme du P\u00e9rou,\" mais en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral on en fait assez peu usage (l.c. p. 398). 2. Detached leaflets and fruit. (Dr. Morales, Cuba, to C. Wright ; C. Wright to Asa Gray ; Asa Gray to me.) Dr. Morales asserts that the tree is not indigenous to Cuba, but has probably been introduced from South America. Against the specimens of fruit D. Hankury has written : \u201cAn odoriferous resin (exactly as in M. Pereirae) in cells at the extremity of the legume.\u201d 21. Flowering twigs, with detached fruits and leaflets (two specimens).

Robert Cross ; Oct., 1863. \u201cOn the 28th Oct., 1863, I came to Inza, where I remained several days, until the bridge across the Paez had been replaced by another equally dangerous. During my stay at Inza I procured specimens of a comparatively rare tree in New Granada, 'Quino-Quino,' a species of Myroperumna.\u201d \u2014Letter of R.

Hayes is attached to the specimen d :\u2014 \u201cFruit and bark of a large tree growing in a wood along the P. R. R. between Gorgona and Matachin, collected 12 Mar., 1861. Early in this month the leaves fall, and soon after the fruit ripens. The first trees I saw were naked of leaves, and bore only fruit. The bark is very rough, the\n\n52 CALYCEIFOLI.\n\ntrunks of the trees being very uneven with deep covesies and projecting angles, sometimes as if twisted. These trunks are from one to two feet in diameter, of good hard wood, excellent for fuel, and of a yellowish colour. They are, with their spreading tops, sixty or seventy feet in height. I have specimens of the leaves, as good as I can get at this season of the year, and shall send some of them; and that there may be no mistake or confusion in getting together the fruits of one tree and the leaves of another, I shall place a little of the fruit with them. The native name of the tree is \u201cFrijolillo.\u201d I could not fail to observe the great resemblance this tree bears to the balsaam tree of San Salvador, but the leaves are very different and the juice of the tree dries up to a kind of gum, like kino, and is not balsamic.

Trimen, who examined this specimen when describing the assafetida plants in \"Medicinal Plants,\" labelled it in pencil: \"Narthex Assafoetida, Falc. : Ferula Narthex, Boiss.\" Some of the leaflets are crenate serrate towards the tip, and Dr. O. Stapf, who described F. Polakii, assures me (E. M. H.) that this plant is identical with F. Narthex, Boiss., and that the leaf in living plants shows all gradations from entire to strongly serrate margins. It would appear, therefore, that F. Narthex, Boiss., F. Polakii, Stapf, and F. futilissima, Regel and Schmal, are forms of one species. \u2014See note under c and d.] b. Branch with ripe fruiting umbels, but without leaves.
