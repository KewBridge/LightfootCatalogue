The following extract is attached to this specimen: ""Among the dried specimens I send a portion of a vine, or large creeper, called by the Indians 'Crespa,' or blistering leaf, much used among them and among many of the native doctors. I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully re- moved and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore en- sues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose. ""There are two varieties, the smaller one which I send, and the larger from Niasaguna, which produces a pod like cotton. From the flowers a feeble counter-irritant is produced. Flowers in June and July."" (Letter from Dr. Dorat. Sonsonate 12, Aug., 63.)",,

Hanbury's handwriting are attached to these specimens:‚Äî ""Agrees well with'Krameria Ixina, L., Mexico,' Herb. Pavon ; also with the same plant marked'Curassao, Mr. Von Rohr, 1783.' It seems to be the same species as'Krameria,' collected by Gardiner (no number), marked as'Common,' on dry hilly pastures in the Sartao, of the Province of Ceara, Sept., 1838; the same also as'Kramerin, No. 925,' of Gardner's Brazilian Plants, British Museum, 12 May, 1854. Professor Oliver and I compared this plant with the species of Krameria in the Hookerian Herbarium, and found it to agree with Kramerin, No. 925, marked in Gardner's writing thus:‚Äî' A shrub about 3 feet high with long spreading branches, on a low hill covered with bushes, in the interior of the island of Humarics, Dec., 1857.' ""There is no specimen in the Linnean Herbarium. A full description of Krameria Isina is contained in 'Lofting, Her Hispaniunm' (Stock- holm, 1738, p. 195). The leaves of the plant are stated to be 'altern, lanceolate, superiora linearia acuta, subsecundilis,' terms which are not inapplicable to the British Museum specimen (Pavon and Rohrs), admitting the leaves to be the linear, acute, subsecundile upper leaves. Gardner's 'Krameria, No. 4094, from upland sandy campos, Serra Geral, Province of Goyaz, May, 1860,' and 'No. 2781, District of the Rio Prato, Province of Pernambuco, Sept., 1860,' is a species coming very near to K. Isina (assuming No. 253 to be that plant), but the entire plant is rather more shaggy, and the fruit has the spinos more numerous, not barbed, with only a few scattered hairs between them (instead of a dense tomentum).' [See paper by Hanbury in Proc. Roy. Hort. Soc., Nov. and Dec. 1864, p. 181; and Pharrn. Journ. 53, vi., p. 469; 'Science Papers,' p. 325.]

T. P. von Martius, in which he states: - ""It is without doubt, Cupania micrantha, Mart., agreeing totally with its description, given in Herb. Fl. Bras., sub. No. 247, c. 1. To this species must be added as a synonym Cupania laxiflora, (Spruce), Bentli. Bentham has been perhaps induced to hold his laxiflora for different from Martius' C. micrantha, with reference to a Cujabian specimen of C. micrantha given out in the Herb. Hort. Bras., sub. No. 274, but I believe this is only a'vegetior,' and thickly flowering form of the C. micrantha, growing in the fertile, not the inundated, soil of Cujaba. If this No. 274 should prove different from the true C. micrantha, it would be necessary to keep up the name of C. micrantha, Mart. (including C. laxiflora), and to establish a new name for 274, but I believe that Mr. Bentham shall not find any powerful distinctive note in leaves and flowers."" [As the other two specimens are marked, in Hanbury's writing, ""C. micrantha, Mart?""]

Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, has always (as it seems to me) an oval (not oblong) leaf which never dries flat. The leaf is also greyish, the flowers dry brown as if the standard were deep yellow when fresh. I saw in Paris (if I am not mistaken, but Triana maintains that I am) at the Museum, 25 July, 1884, a scrap of this plant attached to a sheet of M. punetatum, and pointed it out to Triana, who thereupon marked it in pencil.",,
