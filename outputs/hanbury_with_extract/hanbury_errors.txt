104 MONOCHLAMYDEE.

"The leaf is large (I send a small one), and is used for packing cheese on account of its strength.

"The seeds are covered with an exceedingly hard, black, and thin epidermis, with a white soft pulp containing the oil, which besides its purgative property burns well; the seeds grow in large bunches."— Dr. Isem.

" There is no specimen in the Linnean Herbarium. A full description of Krameria Isina is contained in'Lostling, Her Hispanenum' (Stock- holm, 1738, p. 195). The leaves of the plants are stated to be'alterna, lanceolata, superioura linearia acuta, subsecundilis,' terms which are not inapplicable to the British Museum specimen (Pavon and Rohrs), admitting the leaves to be the linear, acute, subsecundile upper leaves. Gardner's'Krameria, No. 4094, from upland sandy campos, Serra Geral, Province of Goyaz, May, 1860,' and'No. 2781, District of the Rio Prato, Province of Pernambuco, Sept., 1860,' is a species coming very near to K. Isina (assuming No. 253 to be that plant), but the entire plant is rather more shaggy, and the fruit has the spinos more numerous, not barbed, with only a few scattered hairs between them (instead of a dense tomentum).' [See paper by Hanbury in Proc. Roy. Hort. Soc., Nov. and Dec. 1864, p. 181; and Pharn. Journ. 53, vi., p. 469; 'Science Papers,' p. 325.]

a. Flowering branchlet.

b. Twig with young fruit.

Santarem, Para. H. W. Bates, Aug. 18, 1853.

The following note is attached to the specimen a. :

"No. 8, Lacerezeira, with specimens of gum and roots. The specimen of gum I collected from one wounded tree. The tree was slender; height, 20 feet; diameter of stem, 4 inches. It runs slowly like wax, but soon solidifies. It is an indelible pigment, colour of gamboge. I supposed the tree was a species of Vismia. The roots, I now find, are much esteemed as a remedy here; decoctions drank in tea have performed great cures in old chronic gonorrhoea. The botanical specimens were taken, some from the tree, which yielded the gum, and others from those from which I took the roots; not observing any specific difference, I have put them together."

Specimen b is labelled, "Yields a red gum, applied exter- nally in ringworm, &c. Received March, 1853."

" Compared with Linnæus's specimens of A. Schenanthus by Dr. Hooker and myself, 20 Jan., 1859." A label, appa- rently in Munro's writing, states : "I am sorry I cannot coincide with this identification. No. I is not A. Schenanthus, L., it is A. citriodorus, D. C. ; A. Schenanthus, Wall. non Linn." No. 2 is Andropogon Khasianus, Munro ; distinguished by the numerous nerves to the lower glumes. [The taste of No. 2 certainly more nearly resembles that of Khasianus than of that of the ginger grass oil plant].

n. Leafy stem and flowers (two specimens). (1) Deyra Dhoon, Kunnan ; T. Thomson. (2) Sikkin ; from Dr. J. D. Hooker ; 18 Jan., 1859.

Col. Munro's label states: "A Schonanthus, L. var. pratinae Nees; also foliatus, Steud. It is not Cymbopogon elegans, Sprengel, which is a very different plant." Another label, in a different, probably that of L. Bonton's handwriting, states: "Cymbopogon elegans, Sprengel; Andropogon cymbalaria, L. Pulgo "Citronelle Sauvage." [This has the peculiar rose geranium flavour of true ginger grass oil.]

p. Plant in flower. A. Schonanthus L. (fide Munro after second examination.) At first named by him A. Martini, Roxb. From Dr. Wight, 22 June, 1859, who considers it to be the A. Schonanthus of Wildenow. Marked in Wight's Catalogue thus: "1806, Andropogon (Cymbo- pogon) Schonanthus, Linn. ; A. Javanensis Roxb."; and in Dr. Wight's Herbarium his specimen is marked in Dr. Rotter's handwriting thus: "Andropogon Schonanthus, Manda p. pillow T." [This specimen has a caraway and turpentine flavour.]

q. Stem, leaves and flowers. Sydapot, Madras; G. Thomson, No. 298; April, 1845. From D. J. Hooker; 18 Jan., 1859. A. Schonanthus, L. (fide Munro); A. Martini, Roxb. (fide Munro); A. census, Nees. G.

610. Gigartina pistillata, Stackh. a. Fertile thallus. Picked out of a sample of Carrageen from Hamburg, 1871. (Hambury remarks, in pencil, that this specimen more nearly resembles some forms of G. acicularis, Lamx. It is, however, taller than that plant, and more robust, although more sparingly branched than Devonshire and Cornish specimens of G. pistillata, Stackh. It probably was of Mediterranean growth, this sparingly branched form being not uncommon in that sea.)

THILAMIFLORI. 13

61. Herrania alibora, Gaud. a. Leaf with detached flowers. b. Portion of leaf continued from a. Lion Hill Station, Panama ; Sutton Hayes, Jan. 1863. A shrub 10-18 feet high, without branches. The flowers appear on the stem often close to the ground. The fruits are hispid externally. A pencil sketch of the fruit accompanies the specimen. For fruit preserved in alcohol, see the Hanbury Materia Medica Collection.

62. Sterculia scaphigera, Wall. a. Leaves (1) and (2) fruit with wing attached. (1.) Leaves of seedling plants raised at Bangkok by Sir R. H. Schomburgk. (2.) Malacca ; Griffiths. The fruit is the “Bungtalai” of the Siamese and the “Boa-tam-paijang” of Guibourt’s Hist. des Drogues. A letter from Dr. A. O. Black, dated Kew, May 19th, 1862, is attached to this specimen, in which the following remarks occur:— “On looking at the genus Scaphium in Herb. Hook. I find three sheets with follicles, and with the follicles on one sheet a piece of an Enphor- baceous plant in flower and leaf, which I have had cut off, so I send you one of the follicles, and I think from looking at it you will readily admit that it is extremely like your Chinese ‘Ta-hai-tze.” If you have leaves on the specimens in the Exhibition, could you manage to get some for Herb. Hook. as we have none, neither have we of flowers? Wallich’s specimens are from Martaban, and Griffith’s, one of which is enclosed, from Malacca. Hooker and Bentham retain the plant in Sterculia (S. scaphigerus), and Brown in “Plantes Javanices” ranks it as a genus under the name of Scaphium Wallischi.” [See Pharm. Journ. (3), viii. p. 784.]

Cultivated against a south wall in the garden, Clapham Common. 10 Feb., 1869. c. From Hang-Chow, China. Received from Thos. Hanbury as the tree yielding the spice called Hau-teaou, Oct., 1856. To specimen (e) two letters are attached, one from Dr. Hooker, and another from Alphonse De Candolle. The former letter has a note attached in Daniel Henbury's writing, to the following effect: "Subsequent comparison with a large suite of specimens from the Kew Herbarium, as well as specimens from the Herbarium of the Linnean Society, fully confirmed Dr. Hooker's opinion that the Hang- Chow plant is Xanthoxyllum alatum, Roxb." In the other letter De Candolle states that he has compared Hanbury's X. alatum with Xanthoxyllum aconthopodium, D.C., and that the latter is very different, having imparipinnate leaves with 9 leaflets, not terete, the rachis more narrowly winged, the leaflets longer, more gradually attenuated above, and generally long; thin spines ("aculeoles") on the middle side. The secondary ones are more closely approxi- mated, more numerous, more prominent, and the leaflets are pubescent on the secondary veins. The length of the leaf is 7-8 inches. The spines of the rachis are more veined.

c. Twig in fruit.

Pekin, W. G. Stronach, 1862.

This specimen is accompanied by a letter from M. Stronach in which he says the plant is called at Pekin, Hwa- chiao. A note in pencil by D. H., states—Mr. Bennett would call this “X. pipertum.” [The fruit of X. pipertum in the Hanbury Materia Medica collection differs from this specimen in being reticulated and without raised tubercles.

39. Xanthoxylum pipertum, D.C.

Clapham, cultivated in the garden, 1 Oct., 1864.

This specimen has only the flowers, but is accompanied by a pen and ink sketch of the young fruit.

[Note.—The fruit of X. alatum is covered with small, raised, scattered tubercles, which are apparently oil glands. These are more abundant and crowded in X. Bungei. The fruit of X. pipertum in the Hanbury Collection of Materia Medica differs from both these in having a reticulated surface, in which the oil glands appear to be sunken. Mr. Stronach's specimen has crowded tubercles like the other specimens of X. Bungei. It is not apparent, therefore, why Hwa-teaen is stated in 'Science Papers,' p. 228, to be applied to the fruits of “the two species of Xanthoxylum,” viz.: X. pipertum, D.C., and X. alatum, Roxb., since from the Herbarium specimens above enumerated it would seem that fruits of X. alatum are used in Hang-Chow under the name of Hwa- teaen, and these of X. Bungei under the same name in Pekin.]

Boswellia yielding Olbanum.

In the cover containing the genus Boswellia there is the following memorandum by D. Haubury, which may serve as an introductory note to the species present in this Herbarium. See also Pharmacographia, p. 120.

"Boswellia Carterii, Birdw. includes three forms, viz. :

(1) Boswellia No. 5, Oliver, Fl.Tropical Africa, vol. i., p. 325.

(2) Boswellia No. 6, Oliver, Birdw, tab. 29. With leaves crenate or crisped, shortly pubescent, rugose beneath.

(3) Boswellia collected by Carter in Hadramaut ; Birdw, tab. 30.

No. 3 is in cultivation at Bombay, and either No. 1 or No. 2 or both at Aden.

"Boswellia BhaU-Dajiana, Birdw, Linn. Trans. xxvii., tab. 31

Sent to Bombay as “Mohr Add.” It is not known if they present a distinct appearance under cultivation from that presented by the original dried specimens.

"Boswellia No. 4, Oliver.

Also sent to Bombay as “Mohr Add.” There is a great con- trast in colour between the upper and under sides of of the leaf.

"Boswellia Frereana, Birdw, tab. 32. “Yegaar.”

“The specimen of Boswellia cultivated in the Victoria Gardens, Bombay, are evidently not in a congenial climate, and exhibit a weak, drawn up appearance, wanting in those distinctive features which should enable one to connect them with the parent plant from the Somali Country. The drier climate of Aden is doubtless better suited to these plants.” D. H., 26 Sept., 1871.”

99. Boswellia BhaU-Dajiana, Birdw. “Mohr Add.”

a. Twig without flowers or fruit.

From Dr. Birdwood, Bombay, June, 1888.

To this sheet (a) the following note from Professor Fluckiger is attached:—
"My specimen of true Boswellia papyrifera, collected by Schimper in the Faisoki Country, Upper Nile, does not resemble the 'Mohr Madow,' but rather the 'Mohr Add.' I think that the 'Yegaar' tree is exactly what I called in my Lehrbuch, Boswellia acaea, 5 Aug. 1867."

It grows nearest the coast, and always out of the smooth limestone rock. I have never noticed any roots, properly so called, the stem growing out of an intumescence at the base, which adheres to the rock as a boy's sucker to a stone. The leaves, when crushed, emit a powerful aroma of the gum, and in this respect it differs from the other species.'"

P. von Martius, in which he states:— "It is without doubt, Cupania micrantha, Mart., agreeing totally with its description, given in Herb. Fl. Bras., sub. No. 247, c. 1. To this species must be added as a synonym Cupania laxiflora, (Spruce), Benth. Bentham has been perhaps induced to hold his laxiflora for different from Martius' C. micrantha, with reference to a Cujabian specimen of C. micrantha given out in the Herb. Hort. Bras., sub. No. 274, but I believe this is only a'vegetior,' and thickly flowering form of the C. micrantha, growing in the fertile, not the inundated, soil of Cujaba. If this No. 274 should prove different from the true C. micrantha, it would be necessary to keep up the name of C. micrantha, Mart. (including C. laxiflora), and to establish a new name for 274, but I believe that Mr. Bentham shall not find any powerful distinctive note in leaves and flowers."

The following extract is attached to this specimen: "Among the dried specimens I send a portion of a vine, or large creeper, called by the Indians 'Crespa,' or blistering leaf, much used among them and among many of the native doctors. I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully re- moved and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore en- sues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose. "There are two varieties, the smaller one which I send, and the larger from Niasaguna, which produces a pod like cotton. From the flowers a feeble counter-irritant is produced. Flowers in June and July." (Letter from Dr. Dorat. Sonsonate 12, Aug., 63.) 7. Clematis Flammula, L. a. Twig in flower with detached fruits.

b. Leafy twig. Twig, with leaves and 3 fruits, and detached leaves. From the Province of Ceara; Dr. F. F. Allemão; received 2 Nov., 1864. Appended to this sheet is a long descriptive botanical account of the plant, in Portuguese, from Dr. Allemão, who evidently regarded the tree as a new species; but Mr. Hanbury, in his note book (vii. p. 314), writes as follows:—Dr. Allemão has been so good as to send me some leaves of this tree (M. erythroxylum, Allemão), from an examination of which I am of your (Capanema) opinion that it is the same species as M. perafernum, Linn. f. "—D. H.

Forma B. —Myropernum pedicellatum, Lamarck. a. Leaflets and bud, and tracing of a flowering shoot. From the type specimen of Joseph de Jussieu, in the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. The tracing, taken 6 February, 1865, is from Lamarck, Ill. Pl. 341. Communicated by M. Brongniart, per J. Triana; received Jan., 1865. See Encyclopédie Méthodique, Botanique, tome iv., p. 191.

b. Leaflets and flowers, and tracing of fruit. The leaflets and flowers were received from Dr. Klotzsch, 30 Aug., 1853, under the name of Myroxyylon pedicel- latum, Klotzsch; M. perafernum, Kl., in Hayne's Arzney- Gewächse, vol. xiv., t. 2; Myropernum pedicellatum, Lamarck. The tracing is that of the pods of (Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch) "Myropernum bal- samiferum," in Pavon's collection in the British Museum.

Of these specimens Hanbury remarks:—"Four specimens of the above, marked thus, are in Pavon's Herbarium in the British Museum; all have flowers and fruits also in a more or less young state; in none does the fruit appear quite mature. J. J. Bennett and Professor Gulbourn agree with me as to the identity of these four specimens of the above." —D. H., 20 Sept., 1853.

CALYCIPLORIS. 45 Hanbury has also placed the word “No! 1 D. H., 3 Aug, 1865,” against the words, Myrosernum pedicellatum, Lamarc, thus indicating that he does not believe it to be identical with Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, (Bonplandia, 15 Sept., 1857, p. 276), as may also be seen by the following memorandum attached to this specimen: “Myrosernum pedicellatum, Lamarc, of which the original specimen, collected by J. de Jussieu, is at Paris, I regard as identical with M. perafernum, Linn. L., and consequently as distinct from Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch. Of Klotzsch’s M. pedicellatum, the only specimens I know are those derived from Ruiz and Pavon’s Herbarium. These were confounded by Lambert with Myrozyylon punetatum, Klotzsch, a plant with large leaves and pods. Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, has always (as it seems to me) an oval (not oblong) leaf which never dries flat. The leaf is also greyish, the flowers dry brown as if the standard were deep yellow when fresh. I saw in Paris (if I am not mistaken, but Triana maintains that I am) at the Museum, 25 July, 1884, a scrap of this plant attached to a sheet of M. punetatum, and pointed it out to Triana, who thereupon marked it in pencil.” Forma y.—Myrozyylon pubescens, H.

b. Large yellowish leaflets (a) and detached green leaflets in a separate cover (b).

Myropernum, River Marainon, A. J. de Warszewiez.

" Much resembles Myropernum punctatum, Klotzsch, as contained in Pavon's collection in the British Museum, under the designation: 'Myropernum balansiferum.' In the Myropernum balansiferum at the British Museum, the leaflets are usually more acute than in these." A. J. de Warszewiez asserts that the yellow leaves (a) are from large trees, and the green leaves (b) from younger trees. But they are so different I can scarcely believe them to be of the same genus.

c. Leaflets, flowers, fruit, and balsam.

From Dr. Klotzsch; 30 Aug., 1853. See Myroxyylon punc- tatun, Klotzsch, in Hayne's Arzney-Gewächse (Bd. iii. t. 12 of the Pharmaceutical Society's copy), vol xiv. t. 12. J. J. Bennett and Prof. Guibourt fully concur with me in considering this plant identical with specimens in Pavon's collection marked: "Myropernum balansiferum (British Museum; 20 Sept., 1853." -D.H.

"Ruiz, who gives an account of this tree, which was published by Lambert in 1821, says that it grows in the mountains of Panatlahvas, in the forests of Puzuo, Muña, Cuchero, Paxaten, Panpalahmoa, and in many other countries near the river Marainon, in low, warm, and sunny situations; moreover, that it blossoms in August, September, and October. Both fruits and bark are said to be collected, but no balsam." -D.H. Note-book, vii., p. 398.

There is a note in pencil on sheet e, apparently in De Warszawicz's writing, as follows: "Myropernum robiniifolium (M. suerorum); in Spanish, 'Balasmo odoroso'; Chongon, Guayaquil." "Probably identical with M. periferum, L. fide." D.H. Sheet f is labelled also: "A balsam was formerly obtained by boiling the bark of this species." 183. Myroxyylon Toluifera, H.B.K. a. Flowering twigs, with flowers and young pods, and detached flowers and leaflets. A coloured drawing of the flowers, apparently made by A. Göring, is labelled: "Tree, 80 feet high to the first branches, 6 feet in circumference at 5 feet from the ground, no lianas attached to stem." D.H. It has been written on it, in Göring's writing: "Natural size of the flower of Myroxyylon Toluifera; they are sometimes smaller or larger, but not much. The only developed leaf of the flower is white." A pencil sketch of the tree by A. Göring is also attached to this sheet. The specimen was collected by A. Göring at San Esteban, near Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, 1869. b. Leaves and flowers with dissection of flowers. From the same locality, and at the same date.

The following note on this specimen is in D. Hanbury's writing:—
" This branch was received with a large supply of pods, which, though of full size and quite ripe, were rarely found to contain a perfect seed. The pods with good seeds when placed in earth soon threw up shoots and afforded healthy plants. Some pods were sent to Mr. Thwaites, Ceylon, and some also to Mr. Bierendyik, Buitenborg, Java."—D.H.

" The leaves of the balsams of Tohn tree were collected about one league from the town of Mahates, which is on the Digne, about 13 leagues from Carthagena, on the second April, 1802, the tree at this time having neither flowers nor fruit. I saw the tree also at San Juan, New Granada, which is 25 leagues from Carthagena. I am told it grows in the neighbourhoold of Turbaco, but I could not ride to the spot, and I was unable to walk."—S.

Cette espee est en effet, fort peu connue, et je ne connais pas encore une description de ses fleurs et de ses fruits.

CALYCIIFLOR.E. 51 Cependant les échantillons que nous avons sous les yeux s'accordent si bien avec la description que nous avons faite nous-même des feuilles, d'après l'échantillon authentique du Myroperumna toludferna recueillie aux environs de Tolu, par M. de Humboldt, que nous avons cru pouvoir y rapporter l'arbre de l'île de Cuba. Cet arbre y est connu des habitants comme donnant une matière balsamique, qu'ils désignent sous le nom de "Romme du Pérou," mais en général on en fait assez peu usage (l.c. p. 398). 2. Detached leaflets and fruit. (Dr. Morales, Cuba, to C. Wright ; C. Wright to Asa Gray ; Asa Gray to me.)

These trunks are from one to two feet in diameter, of good hard wood, excellent for fuel, and of a yellowish colour. They are, with their spreading tops, sixty or seventy feet in height. I have specimens of the leaves, as good as I can get at this season of the year, and shall send some of them; and that there may be no mistake or confusion in getting together the fruits of one tree and the leaves of another, I shall place a little of the fruit with them. The native name of the tree is “Frijolillo.” I could not fail to observe the great resemblance this tree bears to the balsaam tree of San Salvador, but the leaves are very different and the juice of the tree dries up to a kind of gum, like kino, and is not balsamic. May not this tree be a Pterocarpus, and one of those mistaken for the balsaam of Tolita?”—S. Hayes.

"At Cathagena it is called "Cajou"; on the Isthmus, “Frijolillo.”" —S. Hayes.

"In the number of its leaflets this tree agrees with P. elegans, Vog.; but it appears to me, however, very doubtful if P. elegans and P. grandiflorum, Benth., be really distinct"—D. H.

"Specimens of the ripe pod, with some dried leaves and flowers, gathered near Cairo, 28 June, 1864. The tree is not uncommon in the gardens round Cairo; it is known to the Arabs under the name of Heyar Shembi, and is said to be used as a purgative. The flowers, which were rather past their prime at the above date, hung all over the the tree in long drooping spikes, and had an agreeable smell. The ripe dried pods hung singly and in small bunches at the same time; but if required for use would doubtless have been gathered before many of them had been eaten into by insects."—S. S. Allen.

Often I am told by the natives from Cartagena that it is the same tree as that from which the "Aceite de Canini" (which I think must be Gum Animi) is obtained along the coast. I have cut into the trees in the swamp, near Panama, and I find a beautiful balsam exudes. The wood, as far as I have examined, is close grained, and of a very light yellowish colour, and very different from that of the Mora excelens." - S. Hayes.

"In the tidal swamps bordering the Rio Grande, near Panama; 1 June, 1861. A spreading tree, 30 to 40 feet high. I have only seen this tree growing in swampy ground, almost isolated in great patches of Acrostichum aureum." - S. Hayes.

(4) Fruits. Dorema Assafotida, Kermanahab, Persia ; 10 Oct., 1851. W. K. Loftus. [The fruits have an alliaceus taste.]

(5) Flowers. Flores, Kashmir, T. Thomson ; 29 Sept. 1848. [The petals are white, but may originally have been yellow. Both the pedicles and flowers are free from tomentum.]

[If this specimen be correctly labelled, the plant of Loftus is nearly allied to F. alliaceus, Boiss, as stated in Bentley and Trimen, " Medicinal Plants," vol. ii., No. 127. The specimen in the British Museum Herbarium, from W. K. Loftus, has young leaves of the same type as F. alliaceus, Boiss ; and the fruits in the Hanbury Herbarium resemble those of F. rubricaulis, Boiss.

On en tire de la cire végétale qu'on vend à Pekin, et qu'on dit meilleure que celle du sud, que connue vous savez, est produite sur une espèce de Lopatrum et un Frazinuus. Voilà tout les informations que je puis vous donner sur cette plante intéressante. J'ignore jusqu'à présent que l'insecte à cire se trouve aux environs de Pekin.... Je crois que notre ami Mons. D. Hanbury serait bien aise de posséder un specimen de cet arbrisseau, car il a publié quelques- notes sur la cire végétale."
