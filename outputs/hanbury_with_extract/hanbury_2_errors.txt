6. Clematis Caripensis, H.B.K. "Crespa." a. Twig in fruit. The following extract is attached to this specimen: "Among the dried specimens I send a portion of a vine, or large creeper, called by the Indians 'Crespa,' or blistering leaf, much used among them and among many of the native doctors. I have often recommended it myself to the poor as a cheap blister. In using it, a few fresh leaves should be bruised in a mortar with a little water or vinegar, and applied to the skin for about ten minutes, or until a slight redness is produced on the part. The leaves are then carefully re- moved and a little fresh lard gently rubbed on, when the blister shortly after rises. If the leaves are left on too long, a troublesome sore en- sues. For children, a small rag wetted with the liquid answers the purpose. "There are two varieties, the smaller one which I send, and the larger from Niasaguna, which produces a pod like cotton. From the flowers a feeble counter-irritant is produced. Flowers in June and July." (Letter from Dr. Dorat. Sonsonate 12, Aug., 63.)

H., who adds in pencil, "same as 3660 Abuta, Rio de Janeiro, Coll. Glaziou, in Herb. Kew. Doubtfully referred to Abuta rufescens, Aubl. in Herb. Burchell at Kew, but seems to me the same species. 14 June, 1873."

4 THALAMIFLOR.E. 20. Chondodendron* tomentosum, R. & P. a. Leaves. From Pl. Bras. J. Correa de Mello. The leaves are respec- tively labelled in his writing: "(1) Menispermacae, No. 3, Cissampelos? (Folhas da planta qui produira Pareira brava)"; (2) "Folha da Abutia de St. Sebastiao"; (3) "Abutia de St. Sebastiao." By D. H. the sheets are labelled: "Botryopus platyphylla, Miers." b. Ditto. This is Menispermacae, No. 5. "Folhas da Abutia pequena on Pareira brava pequena" of J. Correa de Mello, and is also labelled by D. H.: "Botryopus platyphylla, Miers." c. Ditto. Leafy stem with detached portion of stem and young fruit. This is "No. 5, Abuta minula, Butinha vel Pareira brava minula," from Theodor Peckolt, Cantagallo, Brazil, 1867, and is labelled by D. H.: "(Botryopus platyphylla, Miers)," and superscribed "Chondodendron tomentosum, R. & P." d. Twig, with leaves and detached inflorescence. From Theodor Peckolt, Cantagallo, Brazil, 1867, and is labelled in D. H.'s writing: "Botryopus platyphylla, Miers (Eichler in Martius' Fl. Bras., fasc. 38, tab. 48)," and is superscribed: "Chondodendron tomentosum, R. & P." e. Ditto, a second specimen. f. Flowering twig, with smaller leaves. This is labelled: "No. 5 Butinha vel Pareira Brava minula; with dried stems, from Theodor Peckolt, 1867 ;" it is also labelled with the two botanical names. g. Ditto, a second specimen, with portion of stem and detached fruit. Labelled as above, and also as "Abuta minula." h. A third specimen, with stem and panicle of young fruit. i. Ditto, a fourth specimen, with large leaves. h and i are labelled in the same way as g. j. A flowering and a fruiting twig. *[The first r in the name Chondodendron is here omitted in deference to the opinion expressed by the late Daniel Hanbury. 'Science Papers,' p. 387.

This is No. 7 "Butua legitima vel Pareira Brava legitima," Theodor Peckolt, 1867, and is labelled by D. H.: "Cocculus Chondodendron, Dec. ; Chondodendron tonen- tanum, R. & P. ; Cissampelos Abutus, Velloso, Flor. Flum. x.t. 140, and Botevogias platyphylla Miers. With large specimen of stem and fruits, both dried and in alcohol." k. Seedling plant, and a very large leaf. The seedling plant was raised at Clapham from seeds received from Mr. Glazion, 1874; the leaf was sent by T. Peckolt, 1867. Attached to this sheet is the proof of the drawing of the fruit published in Pharm. Journ., 2 Aug., 1873. [Specimen b differs from the other specimen of C. tonentanum in the more acuminate leaves, although younger leaves on a separate shoot are obtuse. The super- scription of Chondodendron tonentanum over Botevogias platyphylla in these specimens appears to have followed a recognition of the fact pointed out to D. H. by E. M. H., that the Kew specimens at that time labelled Botevogias platyphylla were identical with those at the British Museum labelled Chondodendron tonen- tanum, R. & P, and were different from the British Museum specimens of Botevogias platyphylla, Miers.] 21. Cissampelos glaberrima, St. Hill. a. Flowering twig, male. Campinas ; J. Correa de Mello, 12 Jan., 1865. b. Ditto. "No. 1. Menispermaceae," Campinas ; J. Correa de Mello 17 Jan., 1869. 22.

The upper specimen is labelled "Alté volúbil; fructus maduras de cor verde muito desmaia, minores que en do C. glaberrima, mas, fructífera, 17 Jan., 1869." Humbert appears to have been in doubt about this specimen, since a letter from Professor Oliver is attached to it in which it is stated:— " Probably M. Miers would regard it as distinct, but according to our Kew authorities and Dr. Eichler, who monographed the Menispermeae for 'Flora Brasiliensis,' it is C. Pareira. d. Flowering twigs, male and female. Desterro, S. Brazil; Fritz Müller. Received 10 Aug., 1867 with specimens of stem from the same plant, Jamaica; N. Wilson, 1867. 24. Jateorhiza palmata, Miers.

Detached leaf of female plant; J. Horne, Botanical Gardens, Mauritius, 1868. Bojer in his 'Hortus Mauritianus' (Maurice, 1837) says of this plant on p. 7: "... a été introduite dans l'île par le capitaine W. F. W. Owen et maintenant est en fleur et en d'autre endroits." D.H. c. Leaf bases, one with free and the other with over-lapping basal lobes. Botanical Gardens, Trinidad, 1873. A letter from Mr. H.

b. Leaves, with detached bark and fruit.

Received from N. Wilson, Bath, Jamaica, 3 Nov., 1856.

A note is appended in Hanbury's writing to this specimen, quoting a statement by Mr. N. Wilson, that'when growing on the plain it is a strong and bushy shrub, not more that 10 or 12 feet high, and having much the appearance of the Laurustinus (Viburnum Tinus, L.) of Europe. When growing on the mountains it attains a much larger size, being 50 or 60 feet in height.'

The Catalogue of the Jamaica Contributions to the Paris Exhibition describes it as'Wild Cinnamon, Castilla alba,' a common tree on mountains and rocky hills, and in lower woods, growing to 40 or 50 feet (p. 36).

BIXINE-F.

45. Bixa Orellana, L.

a. Twig with young fruit.

Hacienda del Powero, Cordova, Mexico: Hugo Finek.

POLYGALAE-F.

46. Krameria tomentosa,St. Hil. (Krameria Ixina, L., var. # granatennis Triana.)

a. Flowering branches.

b. Ditto, with detached portion of root.

Jiron, near Pamplona, New Granada. John Weir, 1 Feb., 1864.

"The root is collected and shipped to Europe where it is known as Savannila Rhatany."

The following notes in D. Hanbury's handwriting are attached to these specimens:— "Agrees well with'Krameria Ixina, L., Mexico,' Herb. Pavon ; also with the same plant marked'Curassao, Mr. Von Rohr, 1783.' It seems to be the same species as'Krameria,' collected by Gardiner (no number), marked as'Common,' on dry hilly pastures in the Sartao, of the Province of Ceara, Sept., 1838; the same also as'Kramerin, No. 925,' of Gardner's Brazilian Plants, British Museum, 12 May, 1854. Professor Oliver and I compared this plant with the species of Krameria in the Hookerian Herbarium, and found it to agree with Kramerin, No. 925, marked in Gardner's writing thus:—' A shrub about 3 feet high with long spreading branches, on a low hill covered with bushes, in the interior of the island of Humarics, Dec., 1857.'

"There is no specimen in the Linnean Herbarium. A full description of Krameria Isina is contained in 'Lofting, Her Hispaniunm' (Stock- holm, 1738, p. 195). The leaves of the plant are stated to be 'altern, lanceolate, superiora linearia acuta, subsecundilis,' terms which are not inapplicable to the British Museum specimen (Pavon and Rohrs), admitting the leaves to be the linear, acute, subsecundile upper leaves. Gardner's 'Krameria, No. 4094, from upland sandy campos, Serra Geral, Province of Goyaz, May, 1860,' and 'No. 2781, District of the Rio Prato, Province of Pernambuco, Sept., 1860,' is a species coming very near to K. Isina (assuming No. 253 to be that plant), but the entire plant is rather more shaggy, and the fruit has the spinos more numerous, not barbed, with only a few scattered hairs between them (instead of a dense tomentum).' [See paper by Hanbury in Proc. Roy. Hort. Soc., Nov. and Dec. 1864, p. 181; and Pharrn. Journ. 53, vi., p. 469; 'Science Papers,' p. 325.]

The following description, quoted from a letter from J. Triana, is also appended: 'Krameria Isina var. A granatensis auffretex vovosus, folia ocatin in petiolo attenuata, spatulatice, acutis, spinoscatellatis, crassit, obvart. 3necris, sicut tota planta pube brevissimam incanis, supratis in horto linearis pungentia acutellatis, floribus pedicellatis in racemos terminalibus digestis, fructa globo magnitudinis pisi, oculatis retrovorsis adnervis maricanto, Laperiensi.'

A specimen of K. Isina from the Antilles, consisting of a portion of a twig with a flower and fruit, accompanies these notes.

51. Vismia dealbata, H.B.K. "Lacere-zeira."

a. Flowering branchlet.

b. Twig with young fruit.

Santarem, Para. H. W. Bates, Aug. 18, 1853.

The following note is attached to the specimen a. :

"No. 8, Lacerezeira, with specimens of gum and roots. The specimen of gum I collected from one wounded tree. The tree was slender; height, 20 feet; diameter of stem, 4 inches. It runs slowly like wax, but soon solidifies. It is an indelible pigment, colour of gamboge. I supposed the tree was a species of Vismia. The roots, I now find, are much esteemed as a remedy here; decoctions drank in tea have performed great cures in old chronic gonorrhoea. The botanical specimens were taken, some from the tree, which yielded the gum, and others from those from which I took the roots; not observing any specific difference, I have put them together."

Specimen b is labelled, "Yields a red gum, applied exter- nally in ringworm, &c. Received March, 1853."

"Pao rei vel Farrinha secca" (gutes Bretterholz); Theodor Peckolt, Cantagallo, Brazil, 1867. [Schumann remarks that this is not a Stereulia—Peckolt identifies it as Stereulia Rex, Mart. (Pharm. Journ. (2), xiv., p.87) —but that the plant probably belongs to a new genus, for which he proposes the name Basiloxylon.] 58. Byttneria lanceolata, D.C. a. Twigs with flowers and detached root.

62. Sterculia scaphigera, Wall. a. Leaves (1) and (2) fruit with wing attached. (1.) Leaves of seedling plants raised at Bangkok by Sir R. H. Schomburgk. (2.) Malacca ; Griffiths. The fruit is the “Bungtalai” of the Siamese and the “Boa-tam-paijang” of Guibourt’s Hist. des Drogues. A letter from Dr. A. O. Black, dated Kew, May 19th, 1862, is attached to this specimen, in which the following remarks occur:— “On looking at the genus Scaphium in Herb. Hook. I find three sheets with follicles, and with the follicles on one sheet a piece of an Enphor- baceous plant in flower and leaf, which I have had cut off, so I send you one of the follicles, and I think from looking at it you will readily admit that it is extremely like your Chinese ‘Ta-hai-tze.” If you have leaves on the specimens in the Exhibition, could you manage to get some for Herb. Hook. as we have none, neither have we of flowers? Wallich’s specimens are from Martaban, and Griffith’s, one of which is enclosed, from Malacca. Hooker and Bentham retain the plant in Sterculia (S. scaphigerus), and Brown in “Plantes Javanices” ranks it as a genus under the name of Scaphium Wallischi.” [See Pharm. Journ. (3), viii. p. 784.]

b. Ditto. Cultivated against a south wall in the garden, Clapham Common. 10 Feb., 1869.
c. From Hang-Chow, China.
Received from Thos. Hanbury as the tree yielding the spice called Hau-teaou, Oct., 1856. To specimen (e) two letters are attached, one from Dr. Hooker, and another from Alphonse De Candolle. The former letter has a note attached in Daniel Hanbury's writing, to the following effect:
"Subsequent comparison with a large suite of specimens from the Kew Herbarium, as well as specimens from the Herbarium of the Linnean Society, fully confirmed Dr. Hooker's opinion that the Hang- Chow plant is Xanthoxyllum alatum, Roxb."
In the other letter De Candolle states that he has compared Hanbury's X. alatum with Xanthoxyllum aconthopodium, D.C., and that the latter is very different, having imparipinnate leaves with 9 leaflets, not terete, the racemes more narrowly winged, the leaflets longer, more gradually attenuated above, and generally long; thin spines ("aculeoles") on the middle side. The secondary ones are more closely approxi- mated, more numerous, more prominent, and the leaflets are pubescent on the secondary veins. The length of the leaf is 7-8 inches. The spines of the rachis are more veined.
88. Xanthoxyllum Bungei, Pianchon.
a. Leafy stem.
b. Twigs in fruit.

(1) Jardin des Plantes, Montpellier, July, 1864. (2) Ditto, Sept., 1867. From Prof. Dr. J. E. Planchon. c. Twig in fruit. Pekin, W. G. Stronach, 1862. This specimen is accompanied by a letter from M. Stronach in which he says the plant is called at Pekin, Hwa- chiao. A note in pencil by D. H., states—Mr. Bennett would call this “X. pipertum.” [The fruit of X. pipertum in the Hanbury Materia Medica collection differs from this specimen in being reticulated and without raised tubercles. 39. Xanthoxylum pipertum, D.C. Clapham, cultivated in the garden, 1 Oct., 1864. This specimen has only the flowers, but is accompanied by a pen and ink sketch of the young fruit. [Note.—The fruit of X. alatum is covered with small, raised, scattered tubercles, which are apparently oil glands. These are more abundant and crowded in X. Bungei. The fruit of X. pipertum in the Hanbury Collection of Materia Medica differs from both these in having a reticulated surface, in which the oil glands appear to be sunken. Mr. Stronach's specimen has crowded tubercles like the other specimens of X. Bungei. It is not apparent, therefore, why Hwa-teaen is stated in 'Science Papers,' p. 228, to be applied to the fruits of “the two species of Xanthoxylum,” viz.: X. pipertum, D.C., and X. alatum, Roxb., since from the Herbarium specimens above enumerated it would seem that fruits of X. alatum are used in Hang-Chow under the name of Hwa- teaen, and these of X. Bungei under the same name in Pekin.] Tribe VII. Aurantiee. 90. Citrus Bergamia, Risso. (Bergamot Orange.) a. Twig with flowers and rind of fruit.

In the cover containing the genus Boswellia there is the following memorandum by D. Haubury, which may serve as an introductory note to the species present in this Herbarium. See also Pharmacographia, p. 120.

"Boswellia Carterii, Birdw. includes three forms, viz.:

(1) Boswellia No. 5, Oliver, Fl. Tropical Africa, vol. i., p. 325.

(2) Boswellia No. 6, Oliver, Birdw, tab. 29. With leaves crenate or crisped, shortly pubescent, rugose beneath.

(3) Boswellia collected by Carter in Hadramaut; Birdw, tab. 30.

No. 3 is in cultivation at Bombay, and either No. 1 or No. 2 or both at Aden.

"Boswellia BhaU-Dajiana, Birdw, Linn. Trans. xxvii., tab. 31

Sent to Bombay as "Mohr Add." It is not known if they present a distinct appearance under cultivation from that presented by the original dried specimens.

"Boswellia No. 4, Oliver.

Also sent to Bombay as "Mohr Add." There is a great con- trast in colour between the upper and under sides of of the leaf.

"Boswellia Frereana, Birdw, tab. 32. "Yegaar."

"The specimen of Boswellia cultivated in the Victoria Gardens, Bombay, are evidently not in a congenial climate, and exhibit a weak, drawn up appearance, wanting in those distinctive features which should enable one to connect them with the parent plant from the Somali Country. The drier climate of Aden is doubtless better suited to these plants." D. H., 26 Sept., 1871."

99. Boswellia BhaU-Dajiana, Birdw. "Mohr Add."

a. Twig without flowers or fruit.

From Dr. Birdwood, Bombay, June, 1888.

To this specimen is appended a note in Dr. Birdwood's handwriting: "My 'Mohr Add,' of which flowers are sent in glycerine." See Birdwood, Trans. Linn. Soc., vol. xxviii., p. 31.

[The name "Mohr Add" is also applied to B. neglecta. S. Le M. Moore, Pharmacographia, 2nd ed., p. 135.]

To this sheet (a) the following note from Professor Fluckiger is attached:— "My specimen of true Boswellia papyrifera, collected by Schimper in the Faisoki Country, Upper Nile, does not resemble the 'Mohr Madow,' but rather the 'Mohr Add.' I think that the 'Yegaar' tree is exactly what I called in my Lehrbuch, Boswellia acaea, 5 Aug. 1867." b. (1) Twig without flowers or fruit; received in England Dec., 1862. (2) Detached fruits from Captain S. B. Miles, May, 1871. Somali Land, Captain Playfair; received in England, Dec., 1862. On this sheet D. H. has written as follows:— "Extract of a letter, dated Aden, 16 Nov., 1862, from Capt. Playfair to Sir W. J. Hooker: 'The "Luban Maites," the plant producing which is called 'Yegaar.' It grows nearest the coast, and always out of the smooth limestone rock. I have never noticed any roots, properly so called, the stem growing out of an intumescence at the base, which adheres to the rock as a boy's sucker to a stone. The leaves, when crushed, emit a powerful aroma of the gum, and in this respect it differs from the other species.' [The leaves are glabrous and glaucous.] c. (1) Leafy twig and (2) detached leaves. (1) Victoria Gardens, Bombay, Jan., 1870; E. Samuel. Two or three plants between 3 and 6 feet high, much branched, bark as Dr. Carter's, leaves corrugated.

Bunder Murayah, Somali Country; Captain Playfair; received Dec., 1862. This sheet bears the following:— "Extract of letter, dated Aden, 16 Nov., 1862, from Capt. Playfair to Sir W. J. Hooker: 'The "Mohr Add," which produces the gum called "Luban Bedow" or "Sheheri," also grows out of the rock, but sometimes

also out of the soil or detritus of the limestone rock. It is never found on the range of hills close to the sea, but on those further inland, and on the highest parts of those hills." 3. Leafy branchlet. Somali Country ; Captain Playfair ; given by him to Dr. Birdwood, Jan., 1862. This plant, as well as Boswellia No. 5, yields "Luban Belowi" and "Luban Sheheri," and was received at Kew as "Mohr Add," a name applied by Birdwood also to B. Bhan-Dajiana. See 'Pharmacographia' 1st ed., p. 120. [The leaflets are glabrous above, with very short down below; whereas in B. Fereana they are entirely glabrous and glaucous.]

Communicated by Hugo Finck, Cordoba, Mexico, Nov. 1870. - Some fruits are also attached to this sheet, but no record of their source is given. A note on the drug by J. Collins is attached to the sheet, see Pharm. Journ., (2) x., p. 590. [The Linaloe of Mexico has been more recently stated to be obtained from Bursera Delpechiana, Poisson, Bull. de l' Assoc.

104. [Bursera tenutifolia, Engl.]; Elaphrium species. "Aceitillo" or "Sassafras." a and b. With flowers and fruit. From Hugo Finck, Cordoba, Mexico; received April, 1865. "Yields by incision a transparent oleo-resin, whence its name 'Aceitillo,' having a very strong odour of Sassafras. The oleo-resin is used to purify the blood, also in gargles for sore throat, and in aphthilis." Attached to this sheet is a pen and ink drawing of the flower, with the following remarks:-- "Petals concave, stamens 8 (four long and four short), sometimes sub-equal; some flowers male." (The fruits taste rather like a mixture of carraways and bergamot than like sassafras, and appear more likely to yield carvane than safrol. The plant has

been compared with specimens in the Kew Herbarium and has been identified there as Bariera tenutifolia, Engl.] 105. Canarium commune, L. "Arbol de la Brea." a. Branchlet, without flowers or fruit. Buitenzorg, Java, 1866; S. Binnendyck. This specimen is accompanied by a tracing taken from a drawing of Canarium commune, by Camelli, in the British Museum; also by a letter from A. W. Bennett, F.L.S., bearing date 7 Mar., 1874, stating: "I have very little doubt of the enclosed being a Canarium, and in all probability C. commone, which is said either by Miquel or Blume to extend to the Philippines. The form of the fruit and the mode of attachment of the leaflets exactly correspond." See 'Pharmacographis,' 1st ed., p. 131, and the Hanbury Materia Medica Collection. 106. Icica heterophylla, D. C. a. With fruit. No. 21, "Breo branco." A very abundant tree at Santarem, Para, yielding plentifuly a white fragrant resin which is used medicinally; H. W. Bates, Nov., 1853. Resin received afterwards. b. Without flowers or fruit. "The tree was a tolerably large one; diameter of stem about 15 inches. The resin forms under the bark quite spontaneously, i.e., without wounds, and seems to exude through the bark. The aroma when fresh was very powerful. I use the resin as a substitute for camphor in my insect boxes."-H. W. Bates. A series of fine specimens of bark, with resin, all from the same tree, are in the Hanbury Materia Medica collection. Specimen b. is labelled in a note in D. H.'s writing, "Icica Aracouchei," Anblett, Hist. des Plantes de la Guiane Francaise, Tom. L, 344, Pl., 133." 107. Icica species. "Balsamo." a. Leafy twig.

Shanghai ; received Oct., 1856. [This specimen also has neither flowers nor fruit, but differs from both the preceeding (a and b.) in the entire revolute margin of the leaves, triangular acuminate stipules, and the strongly reticulated under surface of the leaves.

[Matayba Guianensis, Aubl.]; Cupania sp. "Parica." a. b. c. Leafy twigs with flowers. Santarem, Para; H. W. Bates, 1853. Attached to sheet a. is a note by Dr. C. T. P. von Martius, in which he states: - "It is without doubt, Cupania micrantha, Mart., agreeing totally with its description, given in Herb. Fl. Bras., sub. No. 247, c. 1. To this species must be added as a synonym Cupania laxiflora, (Spruce), Bentli. Bentham has been perhaps induced to hold his laxiflora for different from Martius' C. micrantha, with reference to a Cujabian specimen of C. micrantha given out in the Herb. Hort. Bras., sub. No. 274, but I believe this is only a'vegetior,' and thickly flowering form of the C. micrantha, growing in the fertile, not the inundated, soil of Cujaba. If this No. 274 should prove different from the true C. micrantha, it would be necessary to keep up the name of C. micrantha, Mart. (including C. laxiflora), and to establish a new name for 274, but I believe that Mr. Bentham shall not find any powerful distinctive note in leaves and flowers." [As the other two specimens are marked, in Hanbury's writing, "C. micrantha, Mart?"] I submitted the specimens

to Dr. Radikofcr, in Oct., 1885, during his stay at Kew, where he was working at a monograph of the Sopliadaceae, and he identified them as Mutsysa guineensis; Aubl.] In Benth. and Hook. Gen.

(herbar de Kuth), with the following extract from a letter, dated Paris, Oct. 1853, from Prof. Guibourt to D. Haunbury :— “Myrosperrnum peruviferaus de Mutis, Linné et Kuth (voir Hist. des Droogues, t iv., p. 332). Je vous envoie (figure A) ainsi que je l’ai fait antérieurement à M. Pereira, le dessin calqué d’une feuille de cette espèce qui se trouve au Museum de Paris. Les folioles sont fermes, souvent un peu cordiformes par le bas ; le petiole commun et les nervures des folioles sont glabres (le mâbrû est hairy on its upper side, D.H.) Les petioles particuliers sont un peu pubescent, le fruit manque. Je vous envoie quelques folioles détachées de Myrosperrnum rapportés par M. Weddell, que l’on doit réunir à cette espèce.”

A drawing of the leaves, flowers, fruits, and very complete dissections of them accompany this sheet. b. Leafy twig. c. Twig, with leaves and 3 fruits, and detached leaves. From the Province of Ceara ; Dr. F. F. Allemão ; received 2 Nov., 1864. Appended to this sheet is a long descriptive botanical account of the plant, in Portuguese, from Dr. Allemão, who evidently regarded the tree as a new species ; but Mr. Hanbury, in his note book (vii. p. 314), writes as follows :—Dr. Allemão has been so good as to send me some leaves of this tree (M. erythroxylum, Allemão), from an examination of which I am of your (Capanema) opinion that it is the same species as M. perniferum, Linn. f. "—D. H. Forma B. —Myropernum pedicellatum, Lamarck. a. Leaflets and bud, and tracing of a flowering shoot. From the type specimen of Joseph de Jussieu, in the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. The tracing, taken 6 February, 1865, is from Lamarck, Ill. Pl. 341. Communicated by M. Brongniart, per J. Triana ; received Jan., 1865. See Encyclopédie Méthodique, Botanique, tome iv., p. 191. b. Leaflets and flowers, and tracing of fruit. The leaflets and flowers were received from Dr. Klotzsch, 30 Aug., 1853, under the name of Myroxyylon pedicel- latum, Klotzsch ; M. perniferum, Kl., in Hayne's Arzney- Gewächse, vol. xiv., t. 2 ; Myropernum pedicellatum, Lamarck. The tracing is that of the pods of (Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch) "Myropernum bal- samiferum," in Pavon's collection in the British Museum. Of these specimens Hanbury remarks :—"Four specimens of the above, marked thus, are in Pavon's Herbarium in the British Museum ; all have flowers and fruits also in a more or less young state ; in none does the fruit appear quite mature. J. J. Bennett and Professor Gulbourn agree with me as to the identity of these four specimens of the above." —D. H., 20 Sept., 1853.

Hanbury has also placed the word "No! 1 D. H., 3 Aug, 1865," against the words, "Myrosernum pedicellatum, Lamarc, thus indicating that he does not believe it to be identical with Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, (Bonplandia, 15 Sept., 1857, p. 276), as may also be seen by the following memorandum attached to this specimen:

"Myrosernum pedicellatum, Lamarc, of which the original specimen, collected by J. de Jussieu, is at Paris, I regard as identical with M. perafernum, Linn. L., and consequently as distinct from Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch. Of Klotzsch's M. pedicellatum, the only specimens I know are those derived from Ruiz and Pavon's Herbarium. These were confounded by Lambert with Myrozyylon punetatum, Klotzsch, a plant with large leaves and pods. Myrozyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, has always (as it seems to me) an oval (not oblong) leaf which never dries flat. The leaf is also greyish, the flowers dry brown as if the standard were deep yellow when fresh. I saw in Paris (if I am not mistaken, but Triana maintains that I am) at the Museum, 25 July, 1884, a scrap of this plant attached to a sheet of M. punetatum, and pointed it out to Triana, who thereupon marked it in pencil."

" Much resembles Myroserpnum punctatum, Klotzsch, as contained in Pavon's collection in the British Museum, under the designation: 'Myroserpnum balansiferum.' In the Myroserpnum balansiferum at the British Museum, the leaflets are usually more acute than in these." A. J. de Warszewicz asserts that the yellow leaves (a) are from large trees, and the green leaves (b) from younger trees. But they are so different I can scarcely believe them to be of the same genus.

c. Leaflets, flowers, fruit, and balsam.

From Dr. Klotzsch; 30 Aug., 1853. See Myrozyylon punc- tatun, Klotzsch, in Hayne's Arzney-Gewächse (Bd. iii. t. 12 of the Pharmaceutical Society's copy), vol xiv. t. 12. J. J. Bennett and Prof. Guibourt fully concur with me in considering this plant identical with specimens in Pavon's collection marked: "Myroserpnum balansiferum (British Museum; 20 Sept., 1853." -D.H.

"Ruiz, who gives an account of this tree, which was published by Lambert in 1821, says that it grows in the mountains of Panatlahvas, in the forests of Puzuo, Muña, Cuchero, Paxaten, Panpalahmoa, and in many other countries near the river Marainon, in low, warm, and sunny situations; moreover, that it blossoms in August, September, and October.

It has been written on it, in Göring's writing: "Natural size of the flower of Myroxyylon Toluifera; they are sometimes smaller or larger, but not much. The only developed leaf of the flower is white." A pencil sketch of the tree by A. Göring is also attached to this sheet. The specimen was collected by A. Göring at San Esteban, near Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, 1869. b. Leaves and flowers with dissection of flowers. From the same locality, and at the same date.

CALYXIFLORE. 49

The following note on this specimen is in D. Hanbury's writing:—
" This branch was received with a large supply of pods, which, though of full size and quite ripe, were rarely found to contain a perfect seed. The pods with good seeds when placed in earth soon threw up shoots and afforded healthy plants. Some pods were sent to Mr. Thwaites, Ceylon, and some also to Mr. Bierendyik, Buitenzorg, Java."—D.H.

j. b. Leafy twigs. Received also specimens of the bark of the tree.—D.H.

" The leaves of the balsams of Tohn tree were collected about one league from the town of Mahates, which is on the Digne, about 13 leagues from Carthagena, on the second April, 1802, the tree at this time having neither flowers nor fruit. I saw the tree also at San Juan, New Granada, which is 25 leagues from Carthagena. I am told it grows in the neighbourhoold of Turbaco, but I could not ride to the spot, and I was unable to walk."—S.

The following quotation from Ramon de la Sagra is transcribed on this sheet :

"Observation". Ce n'est pas sans quelque hesitation que je rapporte cette espee au Myropernum toluiferum. Cette espee est en effet, fort peu connue, et je ne connais pas encore une description de ses fleurs et de ses fruits.

Cependant les échantillons que nous avons sous les yeux s'accordent si bien avec la description que nous avons faite nous-même des feuilles, d'après l'échantillon authentique du Myroperaena toluferana recueillie aux environs de Tolu, par M. de Humboldt, que nous avons cru pouvoir y rapporter l'arbre de l'île de Cuba. Cet arbre y est connu des habitants comme donnant une matière balsamique, qu'ils désignent sous le nom de "Romme du Pérou," mais en général on en fait assez peu usage (l.c. p. 398).

Detached leaflets and fruit. (Dr. Morales, Cuba, to C. Wright ; C. Wright to Asa Gray ; Asa Gray to me.)

Dr. Morales asserts that the tree is not indigenous to Cuba, but has probably been introduced from South America. Against the specimens of fruit D. Hankury has written : "An odoriferous resin (exactly as in M. Pereirens) in cells at the extremity of the legume."

Flowering twigs, with detached fruits and leaflets (two specimens).

The fruit is labelled G.D.H. Inza, New Granada. Robert Cross ; Oct., 1863.

"On the 28th Oct., 1863, I came to Inza, where I remained several days, until the bridge across the Paez had been replaced by another equally dangerous. During my stay at Inza I procured specimens of a comparatively rare tree in New Granada, 'Quino-Quino,' a species of Myroperaena." —Letter of R. Cross, dated 10 Dec., 1824, to the Under Secretary of State for India.

Frijolillo. (P. grandiflora, Benth.) between Gorgona and Matachin Panama. S. Hayes; 12 Mar., 1861.

From S. W. W. J. Hooker; 6 June, 1861 (P. elegans, Vog. I.)—D.H. The following note by S. Hayes is attached to the specimen d :

"Fruit and bark of a large tree growing in a wood along the P. R. R. between Gorgona and Matachin, collected 12 Mar., 1861. Early in this month the leaves fall, and soon after the fruit ripens. The first trees I saw were naked of leaves, and bore only fruit. The bark is very rough, the

trunks of the trees being very uneven with deep coves and projecting angles, sometimes as if twisted. These trunks are from one to two feet in diameter, of good hard wood, excellent for fuel, and of a yellowish colour. They are, with their spreading tops, sixty or seventy feet in height. I have specimens of the leaves, as good as I can get at this season of the year, and shall send some of them; and that there may be no mistake or confusion in getting together the fruits of one tree and the leaves of another, I shall place a little of the fruit with them. The native name of the tree is "Frijolillo." I could not fail to observe the great resemblance this tree bears to the balsaam tree of San Salvador, but the leaves are very different and the juice of the tree dries up to a kind of gum, like kino, and is not balsamic. May not this tree be a Pterocarpus, and one of those mistaken for the balsaam of Tolita?"—S. Hayes.

"At Cathagena it is called "Cajou"; on the Isthmus, "Frijolillo." —S. Hayes.

"In the number of its leaflets this tree agrees with P. elegans, Vog.; but it appears to me, however, very doubtful if P. elegans and P. grandiflorum, Benth., be really distinct"—D. H.

The flowers, which were rather past their prime at the above date, hung all over the the tree in long drooping spikes, and had an agreeable smell.

Bentham's species C. pubiflora in having the leaflets more acuminate." - D. H. 212 [Dimorphandra oleifera, Triana;] Mora sp. a. Flowering twig, with leaves. Plants of Central America, Sutton Hayes, No. 69. "The fruit of this tree is a great pod from 6 to 10 inches long and 4 to 5 inches thick; with two fully ripened seeds. Often I am told by the natives from Cartagena that it is the same tree as that from which the "Aceite de Canini" (which I think must be Gum Animi) is obtained along the coast. I have cut into the trees in the swamp, near Panama, and I find a beautiful balsam exudes. The wood, as far as I have examined, is close grained, and of a very light yellowish colour, and very different from that of the Mora excelens." - S. Hayes. "In the tidal swamps bordering the Rio Grande, near Panama; 1 June, 1861. A spreading tree, 30 to 40 feet high. I have only seen this tree growing in swampy ground, almost isolated in great patches of Acrostichum aureum." - S. Hayes.

To this sheet a memorandum is attached, signed W. Dynock, as follows:—
" Blossom, fertile and unfertile, from the same plant."
" Abortive flowers (with) stylopodium, very irregularly lobed or notched round the margin. The umbels are glabrous, no male flowers could be found ; young fruit quite glabrous, grooved, not (as in Scorodosma) plump and hairy; 11 Nov., 1874."
A sketch in pencil of abortive flowers and young fruit is attached to this sheet. [The umbels in the dried specimens have stunted peduncles— barely an inch long, although the pedicels are 14 to 15 inches long.]

257. [Ferula Narthex, Boiss.] Ferula Assafoetida, Linn. (according to Falconer).
a. Leaf, portion of root.
Astore, Dr. Falconer (J. D. N.)
[Dr. H. Trimen, who examined this specimen when describing the assafoetida plants in "Medicinal Plants," labelled it in pencil: "Narthex Assafoetida, Falc. : Ferula Narthex, Boiss." Some of the leaflets are crenate serrate towards the tip, and Dr. O. Stapf, who described F. Polakii, assures me (E. M. H.) that this plant is identical with F. Narthex, Boiss., and that the leaf in living plants shows all gradations from entire to strongly serrate margins. It would appear, therefore, that F. Narthex, Boiss., F. Polakii, Stapf, and F. futilissima, Regel and Schmal, are forms of one species. —See note under c and d.]
b. Branch with ripe fruiting umbels, but without leaves.
Ferula Assafoetida, L., Kashmir, Dr. Falconer ex. Herb. Heber. On this sheet are attached 4 specimens of detached fruits, and 1 of flowers.

(1) Fruits. Sorodoma fotidum, Bange. Anguzeh (Pers.), Herst.; Assafotida, Kemper. [This label is apparently in the handwriting of Professor Maximowicz. Dr. H. Trimen has labelled it in pencil Ferula Sorodoma, Bth. and Hooker, which the fruits undoubtedly are.]

(2) Fruits. "Ferula erubescens, Boiss. (Ann. Sc. Nat., 1844, p. 316, ex. parte), Planta 5 to 6 ft. in faubius albus, Kuhdena, 16 July, 1842. Kotschy, Plant. Persic. Aust., (606). [These fruits have a marked alliaceus taste. The plant does not produce galbanum, and belongs to the F. rubriculis of Boiss. Fl. Orient., vol. ii, p. 995, and to the section Sorodoma, in which the vitre are not visible externally. See Pharm. Journ. (3) six., p. 355. In Pharmacoepigraphis the F. rubriculis, mentioned as a source of galbanum, is the alliaceus plant. It is figured by Berg as F. erubescens. Bergund Schmidt, Officinelle Gewoche, iv., tab. 31.]

(3) Fruits. Ferula Assafotida, L., Hango, Piti, W. Tibet; T. Thomson ; 24 Aug. 1847. Alt.; 10,000 to 12,000 ft. These fruits correspond fully with those of F. Nirthex.

(4) Fruits. Dorema Assafotida, Kermanahab, Persia; 10 Oct., 1851. W. K. Loftus. [The fruits have an alliaceus taste.]

(5) Flowers. Flores, Kashmir, T. Thomson; 29 Sept. 1848. [The petals are white, but may originally have been yellow. Both the pedicles and flowers are free from tomentum.]

[If this specimen be correctly labelled, the plant of Loftus is nearly allied to F. alliaceus, Boiss, as stated in Bentley and Trimen, " Medicinal Plants," vol. ii., No. 127. The specimen in the British Museum Herbarium, from W. K. Loftus, has young leaves of the same type as F. alliaceus, Boiss; and the fruits in the Hanbury Herbarium resemble those of F. rubriculis, Boiss.

c, d. Leaf. This is a leaf of the assafotida plant of the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens (Nirthex Assafotida, Falc), "given me by Professor Balfour, and cultivated for several years under a south wall in the garden at Clapham Common."]

[This specimen has some of the ultimate segments distinctly serrate at the apex, with three to five teeth, and one, rarely more, teeth on the lower half of some of the segments. This feature can also be observed in Falconer's original specimen in the Kew Herbarium.]

c. Portion of leaf.

From the Apothecaries' Garden, Chelsea; May, 1849.

This specimen has very broad segments, like some of those of F. fistidissima in the Society's Herbarium, but the segments are entire, not serrate. The tips of the segments are, however, imperfect. On this sheet are placed some from the Botanical Gardens, Edinburgh, 1859, which agree with those of F. Neorhex.]

a. Portion of leaf.

Carte, Corsica; June, 1868.

[On this sheet a portion of a leaf of F. glauca is placed side by side with one of F. nodiflora, var. a genuina; Gr. Godr., showing the more capillary, erecto-patent segments of the latter as contrasted with the distinctly patent, almost divaricate, shorter segments of F. glauca, L.]

Vous trouverez quelques spécimens de l'larbisseau qui nourrit l'insecte à cire et dont on tire la cire végétale (Pe-la). Ces branches malheureusement sans fleurs ou fruits, n'ont été apportées par un paysan des montagnes. L'larbisseau se trouve à l'état sauvage dans les

montagnes à l'orient du " Po-hu-shan." Son nom indigène est "Siao- k'u li." Il a des feuilles blanches. Les feuilles sont très minces (k'ua-amer en Chinois). On en tire de la cire végétale qu'on vend à Pekin, et qu'on dit meilleure que celle du sud, que connue vous savez, est produite sur une espèce de Lopatrum et un Frazinuus. Voilà tout les informations que je puis vous donner sur cette plante intéressante. J'ignore jusqu'à présent que l'insecte à cire se trouve aux environs de Pekin.... Je crois que notre ami Mons. D. Hanbury serait bien aise de posséder un specimen de cet arbrisseau, car il a publié quelques- notes sur la cire végétale."

It also grows in many other places on the coast of Peru, at the same altitude in the 'Quebradas' (ravines or gullies), on the west slope of the Andes." A letter from Dr. J. D. Hooker is also attached to the sheet, dated Kew, 26 Feb., 1864, in which he refers the plant to Jatropha podagrica, Hook., Bot. Mag., p. 4736, and states that the gentlemen who sent it to him are anxious to have some preparations made of the drug.

"Tambor—the fruit about the size of a pear, containing three beans, jet black, and by pressure yielding a very fine oil in large quantity, rather pleasant to the taste, and resembling Castor oil in its purgative effect, with the advantage that it does not grip."

"The leaf is large (I send a small one), and is used for packing cheese on account of its strength.

"The seeds are covered with an exceedingly hard, black, and thin epidermis, with a white soft pulp containing the oil, which besides its purgative property burns well; the seeds grow in large bunches."

"The smaller seeds are from fruit bought in the market; the larger ones from my garden. The latter had less edible fruit than the others, as the trees had not had their proper allowance of manure during the winter. I send a specimen of the male catkins of the tree. The fruit when unripe is covered with a resinous exudation, and the taste or smell of resin will cling often to the ripe fruit unless the tree has been well manured. -Yours very truly, "W.

In the text accompanying the drawing the following remarks by Mr. Hanbury occur: "I am obliged to conclude that A. Daniellii varies in colour of flower from yellow to crimson; also considerably in the size of the flower, in the latter being more or less narrowed; in the length of the scape, being

simple or branched; and bearing one, two, or many fruits; and in the leaves being six to nine to a foot or more long.

"The flowers do not differ much wherever grown, the apex of the anther is somewhat truncated, the seeds always brilliantly polished. I consider it to be the A. Clusii, Smith, and the Amomum a grandis feuille, the Statoget, of Guinbort."

u. A coloured drawing of the fruits of A. nemoravum, Bojer, copied from a sketch by E. Fleurot, Port Louis, Mauritius.
