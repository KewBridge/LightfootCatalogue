  instructions: |
    Reformat the following botanical text **exactly** into JSON according to the provided schema.

    **Strict Output Rules:**
    - The output must be a single **valid JSON object** with no surrounding text, explanations, markdown, or formatting.
    - **Do not generate any extra text** beyond the required JSON structure.
    - **All keys must be quoted properly**.
    - **No trailing commas** should be present.
    - Extract data **as-is** from the input text; do not modify, paraphrase, or infer missing details.
    - Make sure all quotation marks, backslashes, and special characters inside description fields are properly escaped according to JSON standards. Double quotes inside content must be escaped as \".
    - When extracting text like dates, locations, or scientific references, maintain the exact format from the source without attempting to standardize or reformat.
    Output must match the schema structure and follow rules
  # rules define the key-value rules for each expected key in the output json dict
  rules:
    familyName: >
      The scientific family name in uppercase. If not available, use "N/A".
    species: >
      A list of dictionaries for each species under the family. Each dictionary should include:
      - speciesName: The full scientific name as written in the text.
      - folders: A list of dictionaries, each containing:
           - description: A description of the folder contents.For description fields that contain citations or quotes, ensure proper escaping of all contained quotation marks.
