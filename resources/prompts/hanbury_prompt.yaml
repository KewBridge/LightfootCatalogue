  instructions: |
    Reformat the following botanical text **exactly** into JSON according to the provided schema.

    **Strict Output Rules:**
    - The output must be a single **valid JSON object** with no surrounding text, explanations, markdown, or formatting.
    - **Do not generate any extra text** beyond the required JSON structure.
    - **All keys must be quoted properly**.
    - **No trailing commas** should be present.
    - Extract data **as-is** from the input text; do not modify, paraphrase, or infer missing details.
    - Make sure all quotation marks, backslashes, and special characters inside description fields are properly escaped according to JSON standards. Double quotes inside content must be escaped as \".
    - When extracting text like dates, locations, or scientific references, maintain the exact format from the source without attempting to standardize or reformat.
  # rules define the key-value rules for each expected key in the output json dict
  # rules:
  #   familyName: >
  #     The scientific family name in uppercase. If not available, use "N/A". Might include Tribe or Series with roman indexes
  #   species: >
  #     A list of dictionaries for each species under the family. Each dictionary should include:
  #     - speciesName: The full scientific name as written in the text. Keep the index number infront of the family name.
  #     - folders: A list of dictionaries denoted by small letter followed by a dot. Example (a. <text>, b. <text>, c. <text>), each containing:
  #          - description: A description of the folder contents. For description fields that contain citations or quotes, ensure proper escaping of all contained quotation marks.
  # schema defines the output json structure
