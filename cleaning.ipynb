The leaves of the plant are stated to be \\'alterna, lanceolata, superiora linearia acuta, subsessilia,\\' terms which are not inapplicable to the British Museum specimen (Pavon and Rthra), admitting the bracts to be the linear, acute, subsessile upper leaves.

Ixina (assuming No. 925 to be that plant), but the entire plant is rather more shaggy, and the fruit has the spines more numerous, not barbed, with only a few scattered hairs between them (instead of a dense tomentum)\".

Leaflets and flowers, and tracing of fruit.\\nThe leaflets and flowers were received from Dr. Klotzsch, 30 Aug., 1853, under the name of Myroxyton pedicellatum, Klotzsch; M. perufierum, Kl., in Hayne\\'s Arzney-Gewächse, vol. xiv., t. 2; Myrospermum pedicellatum, Lamarck. The tracing is that of the pods of (Myroxyton pedicellatum, Klotzsch) \"Myrospernum balsamiferum,\" in Pavon\\'s collection in the British Museum.\\nOf these specimens Hanbury remarks:-\"Four specimens of the above, marked thus, are in Pavon\\'s Herbarium in the British Museum; all have flowers and fruits also in a more or less young state; in none does the fruit appear quite mature. J. J. Bennett and Professor Guibourt agree with me as to the identity of these four specimens of the above.\"\\n-D.H., 20 Sept., 1853.\\nHanbury has also placed the word \"No! D. H., 5 Aug.,\\n1865,\" against the words, Myrospermum pedicellatum,\\nLamarck, thus indicating that he does not believe it\\nto be identical with Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch,\\n(Bonplandia, 15 Sept., 1857, p. 276), as may also be\\nseen by the following memorandum attached to this\\nspecimen:\\n\"Myrospermum pedicellatum, Lamarck, of which the original specimen,\\ncollected by J. de Jussieu, is at Paris, I regard as identical with\\nM. peruiferum, Linn. f., and consequently as distinct from Myroxyylon\\npedicellatum, Klotsch. Of Klotsch\\'s M. pedicellatum, the only specimens\\nI know are those derived from Ruiz and Pavon\\'s Herbarium. These\\nwere confounded by Lambert with Myroxyylon punctatum, Klotzsch, a\\nplant with large leaves and pods. Myroxyylon pedicellatum, Klotzsch, has\\nalways (as it seems to me) an oval (not oblong) leaf which never dries\\nflat. The leaf is also greyish, the flowers dry brown as if the standard\\nwere deep yellow when fresh. I saw in Paris (if I am not mistaken, but\\nTriana maintains that I am) at the Museum, 28 July, 1864, a scrap of\\nthis plant attached to a sheet of M. punctatum, and pointed it out to\\nTriana, who thereupon marked it in pencil.\"\\nForma γ.-Myroxyylon pubescens, H.

R. between Gorgona and Matachin, collected 12 Mar., 1861. Early in this month the leaves fall, and soon after the fruit ripens. The first trees I saw were naked of leaves, and bore only fruit. The bark is very rough, the\\nCALYCIFLORA.\\ntrunks of the trees being very uneven with deep crevices and projecting angles, sometimes as if twisted. These trunks are from one to two feet in diameter, of good hard wood, excellent for fuel, and of a yellowish colour. They are, with their spreading tops, sixty or seventy feet in height. I have specimens of the leaves, as good as I can get at this season of the year, and shall send some of them; and that there may be no mistake or confusion in getting together the fruits of one tree and the leaves of another, I shall place a little of the fruit with them. The native name of the tree is \"Frijolillo.\" I could not fail to observe the great resemblance this tree bears to the balsam tree of San Salvador, but the leaves are very different and the juice of the tree dries up to a kind of gum, like kino, and is not balsamic.
